This spell can also turn old “stale” air into fresh breathable air. The air in a one-yard radius, if not renewed from the outside, lasts 45 minutes for one person at rest, or less for multiple persons or someone violently exercising (GM’s discretion)."

When cast in a vacuum, it instantly creates breathable air. When cast within earth, stone, or other material, it fills any empty spaces with air, but does not burst the stone. When cast underwater, it makes bubbles! When cast on a one-yard-radius area, the spell creates about 45 cubic feet of air every second for five seconds; each cubic foot of air will last a single person at rest about a minute. However, in some environments the air created will rapidly dissipate into vacuum or bubble away. This spell cannot be cast inside a living being."

Victims may not notice the spell’s effect until they begin losing FP; roll vs. Per to notice the changed quality of the air. Sleeping victims must roll vs. HT to wake up once they begin suffocating.

The spell lasts until living air diffuses back into the affected area. This takes 1 minute per yard of radius in an unventilated area, or as little as 10 seconds on a windy day outdoors. In an airtight room, the air stays devitalized indefinitely! Purify Air reverses this spell’s effects."

Low-tech missiles are buffeted off course as they cross it, and suffer a -10 penalty to hit for every yard of wall they pass through. High-tech bullets suffer a -2 penalty to hit for every yard of the wall of wind they pass through. Beings standing within the wall’s thickness are at -3 DX and suffer 2d of knockback in a random direction every second.

The wall also churns up loose ground material, such as dust, small leaves, insects, and twigs.

The caster may move up to half his normal Move inside the eye while concentrating on this spell.

Anyone within a full-strength Windstorm must roll vs. ST once per second to avoid being knocked over by the wind. All DX-based skills are at -5, and ranged attacks are at a -10 penalty for every yard of the windstorm they pass through.

The summoned elemental is not under the caster’s control, but must remain for one hour unless it is dismissed or destroys the caster. Note that a dismissal does not guarantee the elemental will leave. If it is hostile, or simply curious, it may choose to stay!

The caster may question the summoned elemental, request a service, etc. The elemental immediately makes a reaction roll to see how it feels about the wizard.

Spider Silk takes triple damage from fire-based attacks.

The caster may shoot as many strands as he has arms from a single casting of Spider Silk; however, the cost to cast is based on the total length of all strands created. Thus, a many-armed spider demon can throw half a dozen strands at once, but it won’t be cheap.

Strands of Spider Silk may also be used to build a web by anchoring successive strands between two surfaces. This web creates an area that will grapple anyone who passes through it; mechanically, this is similar to a Binding attack with the Sticky and Area Effect enhancements (GURPS Basic Set, p. 40).

Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the beast-form is taken and reappear when the human form is resumed (magical jewelry cannot be detected while “vanished”). Backpacks, carried items, etc., simply fall to the ground.

The caster retains his intelligence, but gains all the physical attributes of the new form. This means that the wearer cannot cast spells unless he knows them so well that they can be performed without gestures! Note that Fatigue Points are not increased for spellcasting purposes.

Each hour that the spell continues, the caster must make a roll against IQ; failure means that the caster loses a point of IQ, continuing until the normal IQ of that beast is reached. Should the caster’s IQ drop to 5, he is trapped in beast form forever unless the spell is removed by Remove Curse (other spells won’t counter it). Lost IQ is regained when human form is reassumed.

For most natural beast forms, an energy cost of 6 to cast and 2 to maintain is appropriate; animals with great strength, for example, tend to be counterbalanced by reduced agility. If the GM allows supernatural creatures as beast forms, however, or if he is concerned about the power of a given animal form, he may wish to change the cost of the spell. A reasonable guideline is to calculate the point value of the physical characteristics of the beast form and charge 1/20 of the form’s cost to cast and 1/60 to maintain, with a minimum cost of 3 to cast and 1 to maintain."

description="As Shapeshifting, but affects only one body part. The subject of the spell can be the caster or someone else. Each variation is a separate spell.

The resulting body part preserves the subject’s scale: Shapeshifting a human’s head into a hummingbird’s head results in a human with a human-sized hummingbird head. Some variations bear misleading titles: Crocodile Jaws, for example, transforms the subject’s entire head, not just his jaws – the jaw muscles must be properly anchored!

Some known variations are:

Chameleon Eyes (3 to cast): The subject gains Enhanced Tracking 1 (GURPS Basic Set, p. 53) and Peripheral Vision (GURPS Basic Set, p. 74).

Crocodile Jaws (5 to cast): The subject’s head becomes a crocodile’s, granting the subject Sharp Teeth (GURPS Basic Set, p. 91) and a ST of 20 for the purposes of biting only. Speech is slurred but intelligible. He also gains Peripheral Vision and Colorblindness (GURPS Basic Set, p. 127) as side effects.

Elephant Trunk (3 to cast): The subject’s nose becomes a trunk, granting him an Extra Arm (GURPS Basic Set, p. 53). He also gains Peripheral Vision and Colorblindness as side effects.

Feathered Arms (3 to cast): The subject’s arms transform into wings, giving him Flight (Winged) (GURPS Basic Set, p. 56).

Fish Tail (3 to cast): The subject’s legs fuse into a single powerful fluke, giving him Enhanced Move 1 (Water) (GURPS Basic Set, p. 52).

Mountain Goat Hooves (4 to cast): The subject’s feet become mountain goat hooves, granting him Climbing-14 (only usable while mountaineering) and Jumping-14.

Saber Teeth (5 to cast): The subject’s canines become saber-teeth, granting him Fangs (GURPS Basic Set, p. 91) and ST 25 for the purposes of biting only. Speech is slightly slurred. The subject acquires Colorblindness as a side effect.

Scorpion Tail (7 to cast): The subject grows a scorpion’s stinger, complete with poison gland. This is an Impaling Striker (GURPS Basic Set, p. 88) with the Follow-Up enhancement; on a successful penetrating hit, a 1d+2 Innate Attack (Toxic, Melee Attack, Resistible) takes effect. A victim may resist the scorpion venom by making a HT-6 roll.

Serpent’s Fangs (3 to cast): The subject’s canines become fangs, able to deliver a venomous bite; this is a 1d+1 Innate Attack (Melee Attack, Contact Agent, Toxic, Resistible (HT-4), Cyclic (daily, expires after three days)).

Skunk Tail (3 to cast): The subject grows a huge skunk’s tail (2 yards long), and gains the ability to use the Stench spell (GURPS Magic, p. 24) at will. The area of effect is two yards in radius and must be centered on some portion of the tail. This ability costs 2 FP to use.

Spider Arms (7 to cast): The subject grows two Extra Arms and gains one Extra Attack (GURPS Basic Set, p. 53).

Tiger Paws (4 to cast): The subject’s hands become tiger paws, granting him Sharp Claws and Striking ST 24, but he also gains No Fine Manipulators (GURPS Basic Set, p. 145).

Toad Tongue (3 to cast): The subject’s tongue becomes long and adhesive, serving as an Extra Arm with the Long and Weak enhancements and additional Striking ST – it attacks with the subject’s full strength, but lifts with only 1/4 of the subject’s ST. The subject also gains Peripheral Vision as a side effect.

Turtle Shell (10 to cast): The subject becomes encased in a turtle shell. It has DR 5 and weighs 4 pounds per point of ST of the subject."

Clothing, jewelry, and armor vanish when the spell is cast, reappearing when it lapses (magical jewelry cannot be detected while “vanished”). Items that the caster was carrying when the spell was cast (including backpacks, etc.) simply fall to the ground.

At its minimum cost, Great Shapeshift allows the caster to change into any creature whose racial template costs 0 points or less (note that this is slightly different from the Morph ability). Each additional point of energy, however, adds 5 character points to the maximum point value of the allowable templates.

A caster remains subject to the Magic Rituals requirements (GURPS Magic, p. 8) while shapeshifted; if he changes into a form that cannot gesture or speak, he cannot use any spell known at a skill less than 20.

Mages who know Great Shapeshift can use Counterspell to hold a Great Shapeshifted caster in whatever form he currently has, for as many seconds as the Counterspell wins the contest by (or until the Great Shapeshift lapses)."

The extended limb may make a tempting target for whoever happens on it! When the spell ends, or in an emergency, the limb is “reeled back in” at the caster’s full Basic Speed score. This is useful for reaching the keys outside the cell, or snatching the caliph’s prize jewel as he sleeps."

The spell, once cast, is permanent until somebody puts the head back in the proper place and wills it to attach (if the head is unwilling, proceed to a Regular Contest of Wills). If it is cast on a foe, who then regains the head and reattaches it, the caster has no say in the matter, although he can certainly cast the spell again...

This spell, while useful in combat, has several other uses. A mage with a broken leg could leave his body behind and travel with the party as a head!

The spell’s effects are limited in magnitude; the subject could slip unnoticed through a crowd, but would be stopped by guards if trying to go where he should not. He can get someone’s attention by grabbing him, but is then likely to get a negative reaction.

Stone or brick buildings and vegetable matter can all be transformed into “natural” stone or earth, but not vice-versa. Submerged areas raised above their natural level become dry land; any area lowered below the local water table may be flooded. The GM should require Architecture, Artist, or Engineer rolls if the caster tries to alter the area into something specific.

Beings and loose items on the surface at the time the spell is cast are simply raised or lowered, with no personal injury. If they are inside buildings, they are gently expelled rather than entombed. Of course, if they find themselves under water, they may have problems.

description="Enables an entire area of terrain, with all buildings, animals, plants, and people on or in it, to be moved over large distances. Once the spell is cast, the area to be transported vanishes (see below), replaced by bare earth or open water. The caster is now “carrying” that area in invisible, intangible form (this fact can be determined by Detect Magic or something similar). Beings caught in the affected area have a resistance roll based on the best Will among them, modified by -1 for every additional yard of radius of the subject area (thus, Move Terrain with a 2-yard radius is resisted by Will-1). Successful resistance negates the spell.

Once the casting is successfully completed, the subject area “shrinks” in radius at the rate of 1 yard per second, moving toward the caster at the same rate. Victims quick enough on their feet should be able to jump out of the area as it shrinks (this has good dramatic potential) – make DX and IQ rolls! GMs may decide this warrants a Fright Check.

Beings caught by the spell are aware of a wild, swirling sky above their heads and a physically impenetrable barrier all around them. The atmosphere inside remains breathable and comfortable (so this spell cannot be used to suffocate someone!). Spells cast out of the area automatically hit the Move Terrain’s holder – thus, a trapped mage could walk up to the affected area’s edge, lay his hand against the barrier, and cast Deathtouch at the holder! Captive mages could also cast Dispel Magic or Counterspell on the affected area, forcing the spell to end abruptly if they are successful.

When the caster stops maintaining the spell, the terrain reappears. The caster’s location falls anywhere within it or at its edge. The subject area “expands” back to normal size at the same rate it shrank. If there is no suitable space available, anything in the way is moved aside as if by Shape Earth.

The caster may not use this spell again for one full day. The subject area or any part of it cannot be moved again by this spell (from any caster or magic item) for the same period.

Cast over a large enough area, this spell can place mountains in the middle of plains, open water (as deep as half the radius of effect, transported from lake or ocean) in the midst of a desert – or shift islands miles inland to form hills!"

The summoned elemental is not under the caster’s control, but must remain for one hour unless it is dismissed or destroys the caster. Note that a dismissal does not guarantee the elemental will leave. If it is hostile, or simply curious, it may choose to stay!

The caster may question the summoned elemental, request a service, etc. The elemental immediately makes a reaction roll to see how it feels about the wizard.

An item can be temporarily enchanted at an energy cost of 15% the normal cost for an item of that type per use. An item with only a single use can be created for 15% of the normal energy, two uses would cost 30%, four would cost 60% (very cost-ineffective under most circumstances) and the cost for an item limited to 7 or more uses actually exceeds the cost of a permanent item.

The temporarily enchanted item acts, in all respects, as a normal item of that type until all of its uses are consumed. Once all the uses of the temporary item are gone, the item is no longer magical.

The Temporary Enchantment spell is used in place of the Enchant spell. A single item may not be enchanted with both temporary and permanent spells simultaneously.
Temporary Enchantment can only be used to give items a one-time ability to cast a certain spell – not to cast the spell on the object. For example, a mage couldn’t make a one-shot set of invisible armor – it would never wear off. He could give the armor the ability to cast the Invisibility spell on itself at normal energy and duration costs.

Temporary Enchantment cannot be used in conjunction with any Enchantment college or Meta-spells college spells except the following: Hex, Limit, Link, Name, Power, and Speed. Temporary Enchantment absolutely cannot be used to further reduce the cost of enchantments that already have limited uses (e.g., Skull-Spirit)."

In that case, roll using the skill level of the mage who wrote the scroll.

Pronunciation is important when reading a scroll aloud! If the mage reading the scroll has Accented spoken comprehension of the scroll’s language, the scroll casts its spell at a -1 penalty; if he has Broken spoken comprehension, the scroll casts at -3. If he has None, he cannot articulate the words properly and cannot cast the spell.

A scroll can be read silently, to see what it says. Any mage who understands the language will know what spell it is supposed to be. This does not cast the spell!

Likewise, there is no known spell to “steal” a golem from its maker. The spell is permanent; the golem is “always on.” A golem follows verbal orders from its maker; the maker may instruct it to obey others. It understands only one language (which must be spoken by the caster). It takes no initiative, and ignores any situation for which it has been given no orders. However, it never forgets anything it sees or is told.

Golems do not heal on their own, and are destroyed if reduced to -HP. They may be repaired with Healing spells (except Resurrection) if cast by the golem’s creator. There is no other way to repair a golem. To create a golem, the creator must make its body – doing all the work himself – then animate it with this spell. Once animated, a golem lasts until reduced to -HP or until its creator commands it to cease functioning. No concentration or maintenance is required to control a golem.

A basic clay golem (see box, GURPS Magic, p. 59) costs 250 energy to enchant. A more powerful golem costs an additional 2 energy for every extra character point of abilities added to the golem. In most cases, additional abilities should be restricted to extra ST, HP, and DR (a rule of thumb: 20 points of energy buys 1 ST, 5 HP, or 2 DR); however, GMs may allow more sweeping changes to the basic golem if they feel comfortable doing so. More powerful golems may require more durable (and more costly) materials, adding to the cost and time required to create the golem’s body. (Optionally, the GM may allow less powerful golems; golems worth less than 0 points cost 2 less energy for every character point below zero, to a minimum of 130 energy.)"

An object in a closed blocker container retains the impressions it had when the container was shut. If removed, handled briefly, and replaced, the object will acquire a very faint impression of the handler, but it won’t be enough for a Seeker spell unless the handler does so once a day for decades. It is possible for an object in a blocker container still to be useful; for example, a book open to an important page, and stored in a glass container, can still be read! At sufficiently advanced tech levels, a “waldo” or remote-manipulation box can be enchanted, allowing handling of the object without opening the box.

In some settings, these containers can also be used to preserve evidence. If an object is owned for one person for a long time, and then transferred to a new owner, the original owner’s impressions may wear off. A blocker container preserves the original owner’s impressions. (In other settings, impressions never wear off; they just accumulate, so an item can be used to cast Seeker on any previous owner.)"

description="Through this foul enchantment, the caster can put a victim under his thrall. He must fashion a doll (usually out of wax, but clay, straw, and other materials may be appropriate with the GM’s permission) with something personally relevant to the target embedded in it. Parts of the body (nail clippings, hair, blood, spittle, etc.) allow a casting at base skill. Other items allow a casting at a varying penalty; for example, threads from a shirt worn for years might be worth -2, while dirt from a fresh footprint might be worth -6.

Malefice is a lasting spell (GURPS Magic, p. 10) that continues until its Endurance is reduced to 0. It starts with an Endurance equal to its caster’s effective skill.
The doll can be used by its maker (and no one else) to cast harmful spells (such as Pain) on the target, at normal energy cost, while ignoring distance penalties. The caster uses the lower of the Malefice’s Endurance and his skill with the channeled spell. The target resists all such attacks, even if the spell is normally not Resisted (spells without normal resistance rules are Resisted by HT when cast through a Malefice doll).

If the victim resists the very first spell cast upon him through the doll, the enchantment is immediately broken. Otherwise, every successful resistance simply weakens the Malefice, reducing its Endurance by 1. Upon reaching Endurance 0, the Malefice dissipates (though the doll is still a viable item for re-enchantment, and its magical association with the target offsets one point of casting penalty). A critical failure by the channeled spell or a critical success by the subject also breaks the enchantment, reducing the doll’s Endurance to zero.

Destroying the doll breaks the spell, but it also inflicts on the target a Deathtouch (GURPS Magic, p. 41) of as many dice as the Malefice’s current Endurance divided by 5 (round down, maximum of 3d). This damage occurs as long as the Malefice has any Endurance remaining. Remove Curse frees the target from the Malefice without harm to him."

description="An ensorcelment is a durable spell, usually malign but sometimes beneficial, cast on a single being. The process requires something that is personally relevant to the subject; use the modifiers listed under Malefice.
The caster’s spell roll is determined by the lower of his skills with this spell and the specific spell being placed on the subject. If the caster has assistants, their skills with both spells must be 15 or greater, but the roll is based on the caster’s skill.
Possible ensorcelments include quite a few Body or Mind Control spells and others such as Shapeshift Other, Flesh to Stone, the various “Body of” spells, Walk on Air, the various “Resist” spells, Hide, Invisibility, the various “Vision” spells, and Plant Form Other. In all cases, it must be a maintainable Regular spell.
When the spell is cast, the subject gets a resistance roll if the object spell allows one; distance is not a factor. Remove Curse is effective against any ensorcelment.
The cost of the enchantment can be reduced if the caster includes an “escape clause” – a particular action or condition that will break the spell. Examples include speaking a magic word, being kissed as a gesture of true love, abstaining from speech for three years, and so on. The value of the energy reduction depends on just how difficult the condition will be to meet – and the “escape clause” must be at least possible to be worth any reduction. The “discount” can be anything from 10% (for truly difficult or unlikely conditions) to 90% (for something that the subject could easily and automatically do, and easily discover).

If the stone is crushed without the requisite second of concentration, it is likewise wasted.

The spell’s energy is included in the enchantment; none is required of the user, who also may not opt to supply any power to maintain the spell. Likewise, he may not cancel the spell once cast, although the creator of the stone may specify a shorter duration than ordinary and may also invest extra energy into the enchantment so that the spell will maintain itself. A person may use only one spell stone per second.

A spell stone must be made from a jewel worth $10xP² + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the spell that may be contained.

Any spell except a Blocking or Enchantment spell may be stored in a spell stone. Limiting Enchantments may be put on the stone. If the spell stored in the stone requires that the caster know another spell (Counterspell, for instance), that other spell must be specified at creation time. It is thus possible to create a spell stone that will counter one specific spell, but it is impossible to create a generic Counterspell spell stone.

It is also possible to create spell stones which, when crushed, do not cast the spell for the user, but on him!

When thrown, it flies until it hits something or falls to the ground, and then returns in as straight a line as possible, with a Move of 12. It avoids enemies and obstacles when returning! If its owner dies, it returns to the body – but after that, it becomes loyal to the next person to pick it up.

A loyal weapon can be trapped, captured out of the air, etc., while returning, but it requires a DX-4 roll to catch it, and its constant attempts to return to its owner give anyone else a -4 to fight with it.

A loyal weapon can be sold or given away at any time, but the transaction must be wholly voluntary; it is then loyal to the new owner. It may have only one owner at a time. Limiting spells may be used to limit the class of people who can use it.

Note that if this spell is placed on a Dancing Weapon (below) it makes the Dancing Weapon spell almost worthless. The effect will be a Loyal weapon that strikes at foes on its way back to its owner (but at no other time)."

It has a skill of 15, a Basic Speed of 5, and a ST (for damage purposes) equal to its Power. It uses intelligent strategy and follows its owner’s spoken or mental commands about which enemy to attack. It continues fighting until it is dealt with (see below) or its owner dies or tells it to stop. This spell does not work on a missile weapon!

Any attack on a dancing weapon is at a penalty: from -4 (for a polearm) to -5 (a sword or axe) to -6 (a dagger or pistol). If the weapon gets a critical miss, or is struck by a critical hit, it is “stunned” and out of the fight (unless it breaks, in which case it is destroyed). If its owner is killed, it falls to the floor – but if he is merely knocked unconscious, it continues to attack the closest foe. A dancing weapon can also be trapped in a net or bag (same basic roll as to hit it, but the GM can give bonuses or penalties depending on the cleverness of the method used).

The weapon can also be left with orders to attack anyone who approaches within a certain distance; a Link can be used to activate it only if a certain event takes place. Once activated, if its owner is not around, it attacks anyone in range – closest first, unless the Link had other instructions. A dancing weapon cannot change owners while animated; grasping the handle of a dancing weapon is not enough to make it change sides."

The enchantment is at -1 for each full day that elapsed between the donor’s death and the beginning of the enchantment. Most of the body must be present at the beginning of the enchantment, but may be disposed of after it commences.

The enchanter can pass on as little or as much of the donor’s IQ as he wishes to the weapon, as well as some of the donor’s skills, advantages, and disadvantages. The weapon has no memory of its former existence. Although it has no sensory organs, it possesses sight and hearing (Per 10). Quirks (or disadvantages reduced to quirk level) are sometimes transferred from the donor to the weapon, whether the enchanter wants them or not (this is why dogs are popular; their personalities tend to make biddable but effective weapons).

The weapon can communicate with its wielder through an extremely basic empathy. When the wielder takes a course of action the weapon approves of, he gets a “good feeling,” and if he takes one the weapon disapproves of, he gets an equivalent “bad feeling.” The weapon may be enchanted with the Voices spell to give it a voice. Various Communication and Empathy enchantments may be added to the weapon to enhance the communication.

Each time it gets a new wielder, the weapon must make a single reaction roll, which sets the tone for its relationship with the wielder from that point on. On a very good reaction, the weapon will do literally anything for its wielder; on a very bad one, it refuses to communicate or cooperate in any way. The GM should record the result; the weapon cannot be forced to roll a new reaction by being passed back and forth between wielders!

The weapon’s skills cannot be improved, although skills such as History or Area Knowledge may be kept current through the absorption of new knowledge."

Each missile exists for one minute after being removed from the container; then it vanishes (or, if picked up by anyone but the Cornucopia’s owner, it vanishes immediately). Therefore, this spell cannot be used to make a single quiver supply enough arrows for an army! It cannot be cast on a weapon.

A high-tech wizard could create a pouch that always contained one armor-piercing tracer shell; he could not enchant a .50-caliber machine-gun to fire forever.

This is tricky, because skillful players will find many creative ways to pervert this item. GMs who find Cornucopia a nuisance may ban it entirely. In general: Energy cost is equal to 50 times the $ value, in the current game world, of the missile provided by the Cornucopia quiver. Thus, a quiver that provided ordinary arrows ($2 each) would cost 100 energy to create.

This means that a mage in a medieval world could not make a “quiver” for high-tech ammo; that ammo is priceless in his world. A Cornucopia quiver can be made to produce magic arrows, but only if the creating mage is capable of making such an arrow – and the energy cost will be tremendous."

description="Similar to a Spell Stone, a spell arrow stores a spell until it is fired. The archer need not be a mage. The arrow’s user must concentrate for the appropriate time to cast to “arm” the spell. This cannot be simultaneous with aiming the bow, and isn’t reduced by high skill (but see Speed Skill Arrow, below). An unused spell arrow disarms after 1 minute.

The spell activates when the arrow hits a solid object; roll against the effective skill of the arrow’s enchanter. If the roll is successful, the spell is cast. If it is a normal failure, the spell is simply wasted. Critical failures go to the Critical Spell Failure Table (GURPS Magic, p. 7). If the arrow is fired without the required concentration, the spell is wasted, but the arrow still does normal damage.

The spell’s energy is included in the enchantment. The archer need not (and cannot) provide any to cast the spell or maintain it. Similarly, the archer may not cancel the spell once cast, though the enchanter may specify a shorter duration than normal, and may also invest extra energy so the spell will maintain itself.

The head of a spell arrow must contain a jewel worth $10xP² + $40xP, where P is the maximum energy of the contained spell. The gem is destroyed when the spell activates. (The rest of the arrow may be recoverable, but is now nonmagical.)

Any spell that can be enchanted into a magic item can be placed in a spell arrow, except for Blocking spells, Enchantment spells, Melee spells, or spells whose magic item description specifies “must touch.” Some permissible spells are pointless (e.g., Beast-Soother), since the archer must hit the target with an arrow anyway. Enchantments may be placed on the arrow itself normally, including limiting enchantments.

The only decision the archer can make is what he’s aiming at. If the spell requires a subject, whatever the arrow hits is the subject. (If it is not a legal subject – e.g., a wooden wall for Strike Blind – the spell is wasted.) What constitutes a “solid object” may require the GM’s judgment. If it is an Area spell, the point of impact is the center of the area. If it is a Missile spell, the effect is as if the missile hit the target, in addition to the arrow. If the spell creates an object, the object appears as close as possible to the point of impact. If the spell would normally affect both a subject and the caster, the archer is treated as the caster. If the spell requires a human target, the spell still works even if the arrow hits clothing instead of skin. The enchanter specifies everything else: duration, area, precise effect, etc.

Analyze Magic can reveal what spell a spell arrow contains, how much energy was invested, and so on (one question per casting). Arrows intended for the consumer market are usually color-coded."

Blank spell arrows have a capacity, representing the energy cost of the largest spell they can hold. When a spellcaster wishes to use the arrow, he casts the spell normally, but directs it into the arrow. If the spell is too big for the arrow, it is wasted. After the arrow has been filled, it must be used within one day (by the spellcaster or someone else), or the spell dissipates harmlessly, making the arrow blank again.

All other rules for spell arrows also apply to blank spell arrows, with one exception. If the caster of the spell is also the archer, he can determine its effect at firing time, and maintain it normally. He cannot put more or less casting energy into the spell at firing; casting energy must be in the arrow."

description="Postpones the activation of one or more linked spells cast in its area of effect, until a certain thing happens in the Link’s presence. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires, and is governed like Delay. The Link may also be triggered by the activation of a spell placed on the area after the Link, such as Watchdog, Delay, or another Link.

The caster pays the energy costs and makes the skill rolls for the Link spell and all linked spells at the time of casting. Linked spells may not benefit from cost reductions for high skill. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell for not being able to touch or see the subject. The size of the area of the Link spell is determined at the time of casting.

Any linked spells may go off anywhere within the Linked area. The size of the linked spells must be set at the time of casting. If the subject is larger than the estimated target, the spell either has no effect, or a weaker effect, depending on the spell. Only subjects within the Linked area are affected, unless the spell results in an effect that is not bound to that area – summoning a demon, for example.

The time to cast the linked spells is spent when initially set up. There is no delay when the Link is triggered – all linked spells are activated instantly. The linked spells do not count as a spell “on” for any purpose. Every three Link spells on count as one spell on, rounding down. A mage cannot detect a Link simply by looking at it. Mage Sight or Detect Magic will reveal the Link. If the mage knows Conceal Magic, the Link may be made harder to detect by adding Conceal Magic costs to the base cost of Link.

If the subject of a linked spell is not present at the casting and has Magic Resistance, refer to the original die roll. If the original die roll is not recorded, reroll for this purpose only.

Blocking and missile spells cannot be Linked – other spells can. An instantaneous spell like Thunderclap will happen once; a continuing spell like Voices will start when activated and operate until it expires.

A single Link can activate a spell when the area is entered and deactivate it when the area is left, continuing until the linked spell expires. For instantaneous spells, the Link vanishes after activating the other spells.

No maintenance of a Link is required, either for the Link itself, the linked spells, or any information spells cast on the Link to tell it when to trigger.

Link may also be set in reverse, to stop one or more spells when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell lasts only while the caster maintains it, but the Link itself requires no maintenance.

Link can also be used for Limiting Enchantments; any failure to remove this enchantment can be treated as a Critical Failure. This can remove all spells on the item, strengthen the limit, or have any other result the GM feels is inconvenient for the clumsy mage. Magic items are permanent until destroyed. See Enchanting (GURPS Magic, p. 16)."

description="This limiting enchantment, a derivative of Bane, makes a magic item work better against a specific target. It works on any Resisted spell, providing a penalty to the target’s resistance roll. If enchanted into a magic item before the spell to be affected, the cost to enchant the affected spell is halved.

The enchanter must possess something connected to the target. The accuracy of the symbolic representation determines the penalty to the resistance roll. In every case but the last, the representation must be incorporated into the magic item, though it need not remain intact (e.g., a video-tape may be crushed to powder). If the target is present, presumably he has either been misled as to the purpose of the enchantment, or has agreed to it for more complex reasons (for instance, he’s worried he might run amok in the future).

The downside of this enchantment is that, when the item is used against other targets, they get a +5 to their resistance roll. An Attune enchantment cannot be removed from an item unless the enchantment or enchantments it controls are removed first.

item="Any object. Items enchanted with this spell can be used only by mages. This spell is always on."
description="Infuses mana into an object for later use by a wizard. Traditionally, a gemstone serves as the subject of this spell (for this reason, 'Powerstone' is the generic word for an object containing stored mana), but any object can potentially be used. Any wizard touching a Powerstone may take any or all of the energy it contains, using it instead of his body’s own energy to cast a spell.

Each Powerstone is said to have a 'capacity.' This is the maximum amount of energy it can hold. Since a wizard can only use one Powerstone at a time, a large Powerstone is more useful than a handful of small ones. A large Powerstone can be used to cast a large spell; a group of small ones can be used one at a time to help maintain a spell, but cannot be used all at once.

A Powerstone 'recharges' itself after use, by absorbing mana from the surrounding area. The rate of recharge varies with the area’s mana level.

Local Mana: None = None; Local Mana: Low = 1 point/week; Local Mana: Normal = 1 point/day; Local Mana: High = 1 point/12 hours; Local Mana: Very High | 1 point/6 hours.

A Powerstone does not recharge if it is within six feet of a larger Powerstone. Stones of the same size split the available mana and recharge at slower speed. This unfortunate fact means that the owner of several Powerstones must let some of them out of his sight to get them recharged!

A Powerstone is enchanted one step at a time. The first time Powerstone is cast on an object, it becomes an uncharged Powerstone with capacity 1. Each additional casting increases its capacity by 1. Thus, 15 castings would create a Powerstone with a capacity of 15. But note that with this many castings, there would be a cumulative chance of nearly 1 in 4 that a critical failure would be rolled at some point, destroying the stone. For 60 successive castings, the cumulative chance of critical failure is 2 in 3!

Further, each ordinary failure while casting puts some sort of magical 'quirk' on the stone. Thus, it is possible to work for months and end up with a 20-energy Powerstone that smells like fish and can only be used on Wednesdays. This makes big stones without serious flaws more valuable than others of the same strength. The quirks of a Powerstone are set by the GM, and can be used as a tool for campaign balance. Most of them will be peculiar, arbitrary limitations on how the stone can recharge (e.g., only while bathed in bat blood) or how it can be used (e.g., only on Fire spells; only by a green-eyed virgin; not by anyone wearing a hat). A severe quirk affects the user of the stone (e.g., renders him mute for an hour).

The caster knows if his spell has failed, but not what quirk his Powerstone now has. The Analyze Magic spell can determine what quirks a Powerstone has. Two failures in a row indicate that no further growth is possible for that stone.

Any object may be used to produce a Powerstone. However, it is easier to enchant a Powerstone using an item with intrinsic value. The cost to cast Powerstone is quadrupled if the item being enchanted has a value of less than $10xP² + $40xP, where P is the target capacity of the Powerstone. This is one reason gemstones are popular; a valuable stone is compact and durable. A Powerstone is uncharged when created (though if it already contained energy, that energy is unaffected by a casting to increase its capacity). The energy from a Powerstone cannot be used for further enchantments on that stone – a Powerstone cannot be used to help enchant itself!

'Dedicated' Powerstones
If a Powerstone is attached to an item before that item is enchanted, the Powerstone becomes a part of the magical item. It is then a 'dedicated' Powerstone. The item’s user may tap its energy – but only to power the spells cast by or through that item. If a dedicated Powerstone is removed from a magical item, the magical item is automatically broken and loses its enchantment, but the Powerstone is intact, and becomes a 'normal' Powerstone again. (Of course, if the Powerstone is built into the item in some way – e.g., set in a magic ring – a successful skill roll may be required to remove it without breaking it.) The advantage of a dedicated Powerstone is that its energy, being specifically channeled, is used twice as efficiently. A one-point dedicated Powerstone gives two points of energy (but still recharges in one day in a normal-mana area).

'Exclusive' Powerstones
An item can also be made with a built-in Powerstone, in such a way that only its integral Powerstone(s) can power it. This is done exactly as for dedicated Powerstones, but the energy of an exclusive Powerstone is three times as efficient – i.e., a one-point exclusive Powerstone delivers three points of energy, but then the item is useless until the stone recharges.

One-College Powerstones
This is a variation that follows all normal Powerstone rules. A One-College Powerstone is enchanted in such a way that it can provide energy only for spells of a particular college. One-College Powerstones may not be Dedicated or Exclusive. The advantage of a One-College Powerstone is that each casting only requires 12 energy, not 20."

Whenever he wishes, the caster can move his spirit into the homunculus, no matter how far away it is (as per Possession, GURPS Magic, p. 49), at an energy cost of 4 for the first minute and 2 for every minute thereafter. He may then observe and communicate with anyone in the homunculus’ presence.

Although the caster can cast spells from the homunculus (using his own energy), he cannot perform any physical action, since the homunculus is trapped inside the bottle. The caster may return to his original body at will.

If a hostile wizard gains possession of a live homunculus, he can cast Communication and Empathy spells at the homunculus’ creator at no range penalty! The creator also resists any such spells at -5 when cast through the homunculus. A homunculus is thus a great vulnerability and is only entrusted to the most faithful of servants.

The caster may own several homunculi; he can move his spirit to only one at a time. While thus 'away,' the caster’s body is very vulnerable and should be safeguarded."

Like Malefice, Effigy is a lasting spell, which continues until its Endurance is reduced to zero. Every time a spell attacks the effigy’s maker, the effigy resists with its current Endurance, modified for the distance separating it from him (use the long-distance modifiers, GURPS Magic, p. 14). If the effigy succeeds, the spell affects it rather than its maker.

The GM must decide what constitutes a 'hostile' spell; for instance, Deathtouch is, but Mind-Reading isn’t. Redirected spells that have no effect on inanimate statues (such as Paralyze Limb or Death Vision) instead 'attack' the enchantment. The effigy then resists with its current Endurance. Every such successful attack reduces the effigy’s Endurance by one; when the effy’s Endurance drops below 0, it ceases functioning. A critical failure by the effigy or a critical success by the attacking spell also breaks the enchantment, as does physical destruction. An enchanter may only have one effigy at any one time."

He retains his personality, knowledge, IQ, skills, and spells, and all his mental advantages and disadvantages (including Magery), but gains the physical and supernatural traits of a lich, as determined by the GM. The more powerful that package, the higher the energy cost.

After the GM determines the lich template (and hence, the energy cost), the mage casts this spell as with any other enchantment, but with himself as the subject. At the end of the enchanting, he rolls against skill. Any failure does 6d damage to the caster. A success prepares the wizard’s body for the next step.

To complete the transformation, the would-be lich must drink an alchemical elixir of Lichdom. The elixir of Lichdom is prepared like any other alchemical elixir; it requires $13,500 in materials and 50 weeks of brewing. It defaults to Alchemy-7. Anyone not currently under the effects of a Lich spell who imbibes an elixir of Lichdom is affected as if he had drunk an elixir of Death. However, an elixir of Lichdom cannot be counteracted, even with an alchemical Antidote. The elixir of Lichdom is forbidden everywhere, and formularies for it are almost impossible to find; most liches are compelled to reinvent it from scratch.

When a wizard under the Lich spell drinks a potion of Lichdom, he must roll vs. HT. If he succeeds, he dies, rising as a lich in 2d days. If he fails, he just dies. Luck, as well as the Bless and Wish spells, can influence this HT roll.

The spell is Resisted normally by HT. If the subject ever fails to resist (or chooses not to), he “dies” and rises as a wraith 24 hours later.

The GM determines the exact abilities of the wraith, but mental traits are preserved as per the Lich spell.

The wraith always has a Dependency on the Wraith item (a rare item, required constantly, for -150 points), and shrivels and dies if it is removed or destroyed. This item isn’t Hexed; the victim can remove it and die if he wishes. Only Remove Enchantment can reverse the Wraith spell without harm.

Each Wraith item can sustain one wraith at a time. Once a given item has produced a wraith, it has no effect on other wearers until its wraith has been destroyed. The Wraith spell has no effect on the undead.

At double energy cost, the enchanter can create an item that makes the wraith his undead servant. The wraith automatically gains Reprogrammable with the enchanter as his master in addition to his Dependency, and cannot remove the Wraith item himself.

At half cost, the enchanter can create an item that turns the wearer into an undead tomb guardian. This works exactly as a regular Wraith item, except that the undead gains Compulsive Behavior (Remain in tomb and guard it; kill abductors and return if forcibly removed from tomb) [-15].

The summoned elemental is not under the caster’s control, but must remain for one hour unless it is dismissed or destroys the caster. Note that a dismissal does not guarantee the elemental will leave. If it is hostile, or simply curious, it may choose to stay!

The caster may question the summoned elemental, request a service, etc. The elemental immediately makes a reaction roll to see how it feels about the wizard.

description="Instantly moves the caster to another location. However, the farther away the target spot is, the more energy is required, and the greater is the skill penalty, as follows:

Normally, you may only teleport to a place you are looking at or one you are familiar with. Penalties: -2 for a place you have “seen” only through the mind or memories of another, or via television; -2 for a place you have not seen within a month (except, perhaps, your own home!); and -1 to -3 for a place seen only briefly.

This spell is dangerous, too. If you fail your roll by 1, you take 1d damage and arrive at your destination physically stunned (HT roll to recover). If you miss your roll by more than 1, you suffer no physical injury – but you go somewhere else. The location is up to the GM! A critical failure with this spell can send the caster anywhere the GM likes – make it interesting! – and cause physical injury, as long as it doesn’t kill the caster outright.

Even a successful teleport can be confusing. A wizard must roll vs. his Body Sense skill in order to act on the same turn in which he teleports. A failed roll means disorientation – no actions except defense are possible on that turn. A critical failure means he falls down, physically stunned. A teleporter arrives in the same position he started in. He may be facing a different direction, but this makes it more likely that he will be disoriented on arrival: -2 to change facing, -5 to go from vertical to horizontal or vice versa!

Anything carried on your person, up to “heavy” encumbrance, goes with you. You can also take one person with you by holding hands, if the added weight does not exceed your “heavy” encumbrance limit. On a failed roll, they suffer the same effects you do."

description="This spell is similar to Teleport, except that it moves the caster to another time instead of another place. Subjective “movement” is instantaneous.

The more “distant” the target time is, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty (see Time modifiers, box). Unlike Teleport, there is no penalty to timeport to an “unfamiliar” time; the GM may, however, decree that any timeport to the future bears an extra penalty (-2, perhaps).

If this spell takes the caster to the future, it is the most likely of many possible futures. If he returns from that future and acts on the information gained, there is no guarantee that the future he visited will actually occur.

Similarly, a caster who returns to the past, changes something, and then returns to his starting time might return to an alternate timeline. The amount of variation between the caster’s “home” timeline and the new one will depend on the GM’s view of how “tamper-resistant” the timestream is in his game world(s).

This spell is dangerous – the penalties for a failed roll are the same as for Teleport, substituting time for space. Also as in Teleport, the caster can carry no more than Heavy encumbrance (objects and beings). Roll vs. Body Sense skill upon arrival, modifying the roll for changes in velocity, facing, and orientation.

If the caster wishes to travel simultaneously in both time and space, use the caster’s Teleport or Timeport skill (whichever is lowest), and combine the penalties and costs for distance and time."

Once the caster arrives at his destination, he must expend FP to remain there. As soon as he stops maintaining his presence (this includes failing a distraction roll), he snaps back to his starting place or time.

The return trip normally cannot fail. However, if the caster succeeded in the spellcasting by a small margin (3 or less), the caster must make an IQ roll (at the distance/time penalty), while maintaining the spell, to return to his starting point. One roll may be attempted per minute. If he then stops maintaining the spell, he remains stranded where or when he went.

If the caster wins, he can give the creature a single command, which it must carry out. On completing this task – or after one hour in any event – the entity usually vanishes. However, some powerful entities can stay for as long as they wish...

If the caster ties or loses, the creature will react badly.

description="The caster leaves his body behind and wanders freely as a spirit on another plane of existence.

He cannot even cast spells, although he can maintain existing ones. He is likewise immune to magic that does not affect minds or spirits (which the caster is, until he returns to his body). The caster is imperceptible to ordinary senses; only magic (Astral Vision, Sense Spirit, Sense Observation and similar spells) will detect his presence.

There is a different spell for travel to each plane or dimension. Which spells exist, and the precise details of the dimensions they lead to, is up to the GM. The subject’s senses are altered to correspond to the average plane dweller’s; on a plane of perpetual gloom he would have Dark Vision, on the astral plane he would have his senses augmented as per Astral Vision, and on a dimension where all life forms sense only via sound he would have Scanning Sense (Sonar). Visiting very strange alternate planes can be hazardous to the mental health of an unsuspecting traveler...

The most common plane visited in most worlds is the astral, which coexists with the mundane universe and allows visitors to observe real-world places unseen (at least, unseen except by natives of the astral realm, if there are any). While traveling astrally, the caster moves at twice his full unencumbered Speed and may walk through walls, mountains, creatures... He may also walk down into the bowels of the earth or up into the higher atmosphere. Astral Block (GURPS Magic, p. 159), Pentagram (GURPS Magic, p. 124) and the “Utter” spells (GURPS Magic, p. 170) stop him, while Repel Spirits (GURPS Magic, p. 158) will resist his intrusion.

If the spell ends before his spirit rejoins his body or if his body is harmed while his spirit is away, he must roll vs. HT, using the long-distance modifiers (GURPS Magic, p. 14), to stay alive! Needless to say, his body is totally defenseless for the duration of the spell, though a casual medical examination will reveal it to be (barely) alive."

description="When cast on the turn someone or something teleports, timeports, or plane-shifts out, this spell allows the caster to dictate where or when the subject goes.

The caster must know the spell he is diverting; he uses the lower of his skill with Divert Teleport and the subject spell. If the caster wants to divert a Teleport into a plane shift (for example), he must know both spells and uses the lowest of his three skills.

The resistance is resolved by comparing the margins of success of both spells – if the mage who is teleporting makes his roll by 5, then the mage attempting to divert him must make his roll by 6 or more to succeed.

The Divert Teleport takes normal range penalties between the caster of Divert Teleport and the caster of Teleport (or Timeport, etc.), and the standard skill penalty for the destination that the caster wishes to send the teleporter to.

The cost to cast the spell is equal to the difference in cost between the teleporter’s intended destination and his new destination. If a mage attempts to teleport 40 miles (9 energy), and another mage forces him to another location only 10 yards away (3 energy), the diverting mage will have to pay 6 energy. The same cost would apply if the destinations were reversed. The minimum cost to cast is 3, in any case (high skill will reduce this normally), and the caster pays the full energy cost whether or not the spell succeeds.

Example: Suppose Severin knows Teleport at 16 and attempts to teleport 100 yards away to his waiting carriage (skill penalty -2, cost 4). Two yards away stands Elsdon, who knows Divert Teleport at 18 and Teleport at 20, and who would prefer that Severin end up just above a lake which happens to be a mile away (skill penalty -4, cost 7).

First, Severin makes his attempt, spending 4 energy and rolling a 10. Since he needed a 14 or less, this is success by 4.

Elsdon, using a base skill of 18 (the lowest of his appropriate spells), takes a -2 for being two yards away from Severin, and a further -4 for his intended diversion – his effective skill is 12. He must roll a 7 (succeeding by 5), to win the contest and divert Severin. Whether he does so or not, the calculated cost is 3 energy, so Elsdon must pay the minimum cost of 3."

description="When cast at the near side of a solid obstruction (wall, hedge, cliff, etc.), this spell creates a short-term, short-range gate leading to the other side.

This spell has the advantage over Teleport of allowing access to places unknown to the caster, as well as allowing him to transport more than Heavy encumbrance.

Modifiers: The spell is at a -1 penalty per yard of obstruction thickness; there is no penalty if the obstruction is half a yard thick or less. The GM should not tell the player what the penalty is; he should simply tell him whether the spell failed or not."

description="Creates a temporary magical portal leading to another place, time, or dimension – effectively, a hole in time and space from which those who enter will teleport, timeport, and/or plane-shift to a predetermined destination. The more “distance” between the gate and its destination, the greater the energy cost and skill penalty.

To determine the skill penalty, combine the penalties for the equivalent Teleport, Timeport, or Plane Shift spell(s). To determine the energy cost, combine the energy costs from the same spell(s), and multiply the cost by 10. This cost will permit the caster to create a gate of any size up to a 3’ x 6’ doorway (or equivalent surface area). Larger gates are no more difficult, but cost proportionately more energy.

This spell may also be used to enchant a permanent gate, in which case a few more considerations become important. The caster(s) must specify if it will be always open, always closed, or open and closed when certain conditions are fulfilled (opens only on the hour of the full moon, opens only when someone utters a password, etc).

Several gates may share a single location. Only one of them may be open at any time, so it is common to have them cycle in time, giving the net effect of a single gate leading to a choice of destinations. They must be created separately, but otherwise behave as a single gate. Permanent gates can be “anchored” to a physical gateway; they then resist displacement or destruction at a bonus given by the gateway’s DR.

When a gate has a Timeport component, the creator must specify if the gate merely displaces its users in time by a fixed amount (1 year into the past, for example) or if it sends its users to a specific, unchanging point in time (December 25, 1066, say). In the latter case, since subjects that step into the gate at various departure times can’t all arrive at the same time, the gate either “drifts” slowly in time so as to space the arrivals at least a second apart, or the various subjects arrive in different “pasts” (GM’s decision)."

description="Opens a door-sized portal to a pocket dimension. The portal closes immediately after the caster passes through it (others may pass through it first, of course). The portal leads to a small dimly lit room with blank walls and no visible exits. When the caster wishes to leave, he simply concentrates and a portal appears on one of the walls, leading back to his original point of departure. The space can have a size up to that of a cube equal to the caster’s skill, in yards, on a side.

The real world completely loses touch with the occupants of the pocket dimension; Seeker won’t find them, Trace will lose them for the duration (but will pick them up as soon as they step back out) and so on. Of course, the reverse is also true.

Long-term visits to the pocket dimension will require the creation of air, food, and water (and decent lighting, for comfort’s sake), as well as the disposal of wastes. This is slightly complicated by the fact that the pocket dimension is low-mana; all spell-casting is at -5, and the Recover Energy spell doesn’t work.

Should the spell expire or the caster lose consciousness, all the room’s contents reappear as if teleported; its occupants each take 1d of damage and are physically stunned if they fail a Body Sense roll. This also happens to anyone who is foolish enough not to exit before the caster!

If the caster wishes to return to the real world, but not to his point of departure, he may cast an appropriate magical transport spell from the pocket dimension as if he were casting it from the departure point (if he is willing to take the risk of a low-mana casting).

Note: This “default” description of the pocket universe created by this spell should by no means be taken as gospel. A less bare-bones version might include opulent (but magical and temporary) furnishings and features, illusionary windows, and so on. In some worlds, this will be determined by the GM’s views on alternate dimensions. In others, the details of sanctuary dimensions might be conscious, or unconscious, reflections of the mage’s personality."

From the outside, the area appears to be surrounded by a perfectly reflective surface, which nothing (including magic and magical beings) can cross. Objects thrown at it bounce off. Any spell requiring concentration and lying outside the area immediately lapses if its caster is caught inside.

description="The area and all within it are temporarily removed from the time stream; the effect is equivalent to having the area’s time accelerated infinitely. Unlike Suspend Time, this spell can only be cast from the inside, centered on the caster (the spell ends as soon as he touches its edge). Should the caster die alone in the area, the spell will never end! The caster and any objects caught in the area would simply seem to vanish from the time stream.

As far as any outside observers are concerned, the area “ages” instantaneously (which may or may not be perceptible). One moment five ogres were attacking the party while their wizard cast a spell, and the next moment the ogres were dead, the party magically healed, and everybody was in a different position and drinking rum to celebrate.

From the inside, the area is bounded by a wall (and covered by a ceiling) of utter blackness. Anyone or anything touching the edge of the area is immediately expelled from the area, back into normal time. This causes an automatic mental stun to anyone other than the caster. Missiles of any sort can be thrown blindly out of the area (see Shooting Blind, GURPS Basic Set, p. 389) but not into it. Note that, since all missiles fired out of the area will emerge at the same outside time, an archer could create an impressive burst of arrows by simply firing casually for a few subjective hours...

Spells involving the outside simply fail. Any spell requiring concentration and lying inside the area lapses immediately if its caster is left outside. Likewise, any inside spell whose maintenance comes due during the Time Out lapses unless its caster is also inside.

The “flow” of mana into the Time Out area is effectively nil. Powerstones won’t recharge, enchantment is impossible, etc. Mages still recover lost energy (the physical consequences of manipulating mana go away regardless of the local mana supply), but GMs may decree that spells cost much more, or are impossible, within the time-stopped area (since the power must be drawn entirely from the caster’s personal life-force). This is entirely dependent on the GM’s view of mana in his setting."

In many settings, this spell is an intrinsic part of funeral rites, and may be restricted to the clergy. GMs may wish to change the prerequisite from Magery to Power Investiture or Blessed. In other settings, this spell is unnecessary; ordinary nonmagical funeral rites are sufficient to safeguard the dead from necromancy.

description="This spell can be cast on any creation or illusion the caster controls, giving it a semblance of intelligence in order to act on its own initiative. The subject is totally loyal to the caster, and obeys him (or anyone else the caster orders it to heed) to the best of its ability.

The base cost of the spell is based on what knowledge the caster grants the subject. Creations start with their own DX and IQ as listed in the spell description. For the purposes of this spell, Illusions and Phantoms start with IQ 0 and DX 8. The subject’s DX and IQ may be raised as high as the caster’s. The subject may also be given the caster’s skills – every skill granted is known at the same relative level as the caster. Illusions and creations with Initiative may use defaults on any skill.

Once the spell is cast, the subject acts on its own until the spell expires. If the subject comes across a situation that confuses it, it attempts to return to the caster for clarification. Like Independence, this spell does not count as a spell “on,” and does not require separate maintenance.

Example: Lady Ann Goulding has created a magical servant to amuse her noble and decadent guests. She wishes it to circulate throughout the party, serving food, dancing with the noblewomen, and showing appropriate respect – without requiring constant supervision, so that she can enjoy herself. It begins with 9 in every attribute, but no skills (Lady Ann could have created a skilled servitor, but she has Create Servant-15 and can maintain an unskilled one indefinitely). To this base she adds 2 points of DX (bringing it up to her own DX of 11), and 2 points of IQ (well below her own IQ of 14) to make it wittier. This is a total attribute increase of 4, for a base cost of 2.

Lady Ann then gives it two skills – Dancing and Savoir-Faire. She has Dancing-14 (DX+3), and since the servant has the same DX as she does, the servant will, too. The lady’s knowledge of Savoir-Faire is considerable (skill 15, or IQ+1), but the servant is not as smart as she, and will only have it at its own IQ+1, for a net Savoir-Faire-13. These two skills add 2 more to the base cost, for a total of 4. Since the servant is less than 1 yard in radius, a casting at base cost will suffice."

The mount can only understand very simple spoken commands, such as stop, go, left, right, about face, etc. It is under the GM’s control and cannot fight or handle confusing situations; it has no skills.

The shade will not lie (except on a critical failure) but it will be disoriented; therefore its answers may be unclear and imprecise. One question may be asked per minute the spell is maintained. Since the shade only comes from the most likely future, this spell may be an unsatisfactory augury.

Example: Felix Magister might summon a shade of his friend Rudolph from two months ahead, and ask if his attack on the dragon succeeded – and then, if the answer was 'no,' persuade the real Rudolph not to try. The shade simply came from a different future. Of course, the shade might also reply 'no – it was called off.'

At the time from which the shade is drawn, the subject will have a vivid dream in which he will see his questioner(s) and remember all that is said – if the predicted event came true.

Skill modifiers: -1 for each year in the future that the shade is drawn; -5 if the subject is not present or -10 if nothing pertaining to the subject (clothing, hair clippings, etc.) is present; -10 if the subject’s full name is not known.

This spell may not be attempted more than once per year on the same person. This is a very powerful spell, and GMs may wish to restrict access to this spell, or require expensive materials."

description="Creates detailed technical “blue-prints” of the machine subject in the caster’s mind. The caster can browse through the mental schematic at his leisure or the same rate that he could examine actual hardcopy plans for the machine. However, this spell grants no appropriate skills; to interpret, for instance, a schematic of a starship’s fusion power plant, the caster would need some skill in Engineering (Fusion). To make any use of a schematic of a weapon, either Armoury or some sort of weapons Engineering would be required. The duration is the length of time that the image stays with any useful clarity in the caster’s mind. The caster must touch the subject during the casting.

The schematic can either represent the current state of the object (showing any internal damage, alterations, and wear), or the ideal state of the object, at the caster’s discretion. Both can be useful. The latter use even gives plans for an object based only on a tiny fraction of it (at least 5% of the machine’s total mass needs to be present). This could be used to form a complete picture from a fragmented Precursor device, for instance. In either case, the cost to cast the spell is based on the mass of the intact machine. The schematic image, even when maintained by the mage, does not count as a spell “on” for penalty purposes."

A simple curve can be sufficient to cook meat; a large and precise one could be used to melt lead, given sufficient sunlight at appropriate angles.

Whether or not damage gets through armor, a hit to the face blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll. A hit to the eyes does double damage and blinds the victim unless he makes a HT roll at a penalty equal to the damage suffered. Treat Sunbolt-induced blindness as a crippling injury for recovery purposes (GURPS Basic Set, p. 420).

Any mirror will reflect a Sunbolt; if the GM is uncertain of the exact angle of incidence/reflection (if the Sunbolt hits a hand-held mirror, for instance), determine its new direction randomly. Use the rules for hitting the wrong target (GURPS Basic Set, p. 389) to determine if anything along the new path is hit.

Deliberately reflected shots are a much trickier matter; range penalties will be for the total range to the target, with an additional -2 for each “bounce.” And unless the mirrors are very large and/or stable and/or deliberately placed for the purpose, the GM may simply declare the shot impossible.

Defending characters holding mirrors may attempt to reflect the bolt back at the caster – treat this as a Block defense at a -2 penalty; also apply the normal range penalties from the defender to the caster. The DB of the mirror (if it is large enough to offer any; GM call) adds to this roll normally. The caster may defend normally, unless totally surprised.

Sunbolt is not affected by Missile Shield or Reverse Missiles. Force Dome and Deflect Energy do offer protection. Areas of magical Darkness or Blackout resist Sunbolt."

Nonmagical creatures – including mages – can freely cross a pentagram, though they cannot cast spells across its border. Spells of transport (e.g., Flight, Teleport) cannot be used to enter a pentagram for hostile purposes.

Certain very hostile creatures may be summoned within a pentagram; the caster stands outside and summons the creature to a spot inside the pentagram. The caster will open the pentagram only when he is sure he can control the summoned creature.

If part of the pentagram is cut or erased, its power will be lost until the caster can rejoin the pentagram – all this requires is a piece of chalk and time (usually just a second) to draw the line. No magic spell can injure the pentagram, but physical attacks – like walking up and scuffing out a line with your shoe – can succeed if they are made by nonmagical beings. A demon or creation could not do it; an ordinary person could. Likewise, an ordinary person could throw a rock into a pentagram, but a demon or golem could not.

A magical creature may try to force its way through a pentagram. Roll a contest between the creature’s (ST+Will)/2 and the skill with which the pentagram was cast. If the creature wins, it destroys the pentagram! No one creature can thus “test” a pentagram more than once per day."

Use the cost and casting penalties from the Teleport spell (GURPS Magic, p. 147). Spells cast from the Telecast’s “other end” measure range from that spot. The Telecast counts as a spell “on” and requires concentration. GMs who wish to further limit this powerful spell may apply the penalties for no speech, foot, or hand motions (GURPS Magic, p. 9).

If the Telecast roll is failed by 1, the Wizard Eye reaches its intended destination but the caster is mentally stunned. If the roll is failed by more than 1, the Wizard Eye winds up somewhere else (GM’s choice!) and the caster is still mentally stunned. In all cases, a Body Sense roll at a -2 penalty is required before the caster can get his bearings and start casting another spell; on a critical failure, he is mentally stunned.

Range penalties, spells “on,” magic resistance, mana level changes and the like are applied at the subject spell’s activation time.

The caster must pay full energy and time costs for the Hang Spell and its subject must be paid at the time of casting. If the caster hangs a spell tailored to a human-sized subject and then activates it on a larger subject, there is either no effect or a reduced effect, as the GM sees fit.

A hung spell counts as one spell “on” (GURPS Magic, p. 10) for casting purposes; it does not, however, count against itself when it is activated. Thus, if a mage has four hung spells, he casts other spells at -4, but casts any one of the hung spells at -3. A hung spell takes a Concentrate action to activate.

All thrown spells take effect at the moment they hit something. Thrown Area spells center on their point of impact. Jet spells take effect at the point of impact, in the direction they were going (treat them as Wild Swings, GURPS Basic Set, p. 388). Most other spells simply allow the caster to use spells at longer ranges than normally possible – a thrown Sense Emotion, for instance, or Minor Healing. This spell allows spells that normally require touch to be applied at a distance (Deathtouch, for instance). Missile spells and Blocking spells may not be thrown.

The modification will not affect critical successes and failures. This lasts indefinitely... until the subject fails some die roll (or a foe makes a good die roll) and the subject is in some serious danger.

Then the blessing miraculously averts or reduces the danger – and ends. It is up to the GM to decide when the blessing has its final effect, and what form the protection takes.

description="This spell is cast on another spell to delay its activation until a certain thing happens in the linked spell’s presence – that is, in the presence of the item or area on which the linked spell was cast. This triggering event may be as simple or complex as the caster desires; if complex, it should be put in writing. The triggering event must be something that could reasonably be determined by a normal person at the Delay site; the GM’s decision is final. If the Delay is to be triggered by a more esoteric event, an appropriate spell such as Mage Sight may be cast on the Delay. The Delay may also be triggered by the activation of another spell, such as Watchdog or another linked spell. A Delay can activate only one other spell.

The spells are cast one after the other, with no delays between spells. The Delay must be cast first, and counts as a spell “on” when determining the skill level of the linked spell – see GURPS Magic, p. 10. Full cost for the linked spell and for the Delay must be paid at the time of casting. If the caster specifies a spell to affect a human-sized subject, and a larger victim (requiring more energy – see GURPS Magic, p. 11) actually triggers the Delay, there is either no effect or reduced effect, depending on the spell. The GM’s ruling on this is final.

Delay may be cast two ways: to activate the linked spell on a specific subject, or as a trap, to activate the linked spell against any subject that meets the triggering conditions. In the latter case, the Delay and the linked spell are both cast on a “trap item,” and range is figured from the trap item at the moment the spell is triggered. Magic Resistance penalties also apply to the linked spell at the time of triggering.

The caster rolls for Delay when it is first cast; the roll for the linked spell is not made until the triggering event occurs. If the intended subject of a linked spell is not present at the time of casting, there is an additional -5 penalty for the linked spell (but not for the Delay) for not being able to touch or see the subject – see GURPS Magic, p. 11. So, for instance, the dreaded “deathtouch doorknob,” set to “attack” the first person to touch it, would activate at a -5 penalty.

When a Delay is triggered, the linked spell begins to activate, taking effect the next turn. Thus, a Delay cannot be used as a Blocking spell. It can be used as a trap; the victim may be taken by surprise. An unsuspecting victim must make an IQ roll to respond before the linked spell is fully activated – Combat Reflexes gives +6 to this roll.

Both the Delay and the linked spell count as “on” for spellcasting purposes; if an Information spell has been added, it is also on. The linked spell does not need to be maintained, though the Delay or its Information spell may need to be. Once the Delay is triggered, it vanishes, and no longer counts as on. The linked spell continues to count as on as long as it is active. It may be maintained normally.

A Delay may also be set to “turn off” an ongoing spell when a triggering event occurs. In that case, the linked spell lasts only while the caster maintains it, but the Delay itself requires no maintenance.

Blocking and Missile spells cannot be Delayed – all other spells can. An “instantaneous” spell like Thunderclap will happen once, when activated; then the spell will be gone. A continuing spell like Voices will start when activated, and then operate until it expires."

description="This spell is cast on another spell. It converts that spell to function as a Blocking spell for one time only, then disappear. Unlike Delay or Link, a Reflexed spell is triggered by the will of the caster, not by an external event. This means that while Reverse Missiles may be Reflexed to activate if the caster sees someone shoot at him, it will not be triggered by a shot in the back. It is treated as an active defense, similar to Parry or Block for all practical purposes (except retreating does not add 3 to the roll). Casting a Reflexed spell will interrupt any spell the caster is concentrating on, and is handled like any other Blocking spell – see GURPS Magic, p. 12-13.

When Reflex is cast, the linked spell must be cast immediately after Reflex, by the same caster. Each casting of Reflex will only work on one spell – it is not possible to have multiple spells operate as one Blocking spell. The skill roll for Reflex is rolled at the time of casting, but the roll for the linked spell is not made until it is cast as a Blocking spell. The energy cost for Reflex is paid at the time of casting Reflex, but the energy for the Reflexed spell is not paid until it is cast, whether as an active defense or otherwise. The time to cast a Reflexed spell is spent immediately after the Reflex is cast, but the success roll and energy cost are handled later.

A Reflexed spell counts as one spell “on” for spellcasting purposes – see GURPS Magic, p. 10. A Reflexed spell does not count as “on” when making the roll to cast itself. Thus, if a mage has four Reflexed spells on, any other spell he casts is at -4, but when he casts one of the Reflexed spells, it is only at -3 for the other three Reflexed spells on.

A Reflexed spell may be cast only once. It then disappears, and no longer counts as a spell on. The effects are immediate, and the duration is instantaneous, not the duration listed for the original spell. This means that it is extravagant or even useless to cast certain spells as Reflexed! A Force Dome, for example, would stop one physical attack, then disappear – a fatiguing, but effective, defense! A Created Animal will appear, then disappear before it can make any action. (It might stop a missile during its brief existence, however. The GM may rule such an animal must be nearly equal in size to the target it is shielding.) Exceptions to this instantaneous-result rule are spells with permanent results, such as Major Healing – their effects are indeed permanent.

Any person may carry any number of Reflexes. However, only one spell may be cast in any one turn. Remember also, that if a Reflexed spell is used as an active defense, no other active defense may be used against that attack, unless All-Out Defense is chosen. See GURPS Basic Set, p. 366.

A Reflexed spell may be cast as a regular action – it does not have to be cast as a defense. It takes one second to cast, regardless of the time it would normally require to cast.

All normal modifiers for distance and Magic Resistance are used when casting the Reflexed spell, if the subject of the Reflexed spell is distant from the person or object the Reflex itself is cast on.

Note that a mage may cast a Reflex on another person. The caster (not the subject) may activate it at any time, using long-distance modifiers. If the linked spell is cast on a subject other than the subject of the Reflex itself, the regular modifier for the distance to that subject is added to the long-distance modifier for the caster.

Example: Felix gives Beast-Soother as a Reflexed spell to Rudolph. Felix then activates a Wizard Eye to keep tabs on Rudolph as he goes hunting. Rudolph meets a short-tempered wild boar, which Felix observes through the Wizard Eye. Rudolph cannot activate the spell. Fortunately, he does not have to! Felix activates Beast-Soother as Rudolph tries an Animal Handling roll to calm the boar. Rudolph has gone about two miles into the woods, so Felix is at -3 for long distance. The boar is 3 yards away from Rudolph, so Felix is at another -3 for the range to the subject of the Reflexed spell. He is also at -1 for having Wizard Eye on. Thus, Felix casts Beast-Soother at -7, and pays the energy for the spell at that time. Fortunately he has it at level 21, so he casts it for the maximum effect. The boar is indeed calmed, and Rudolph goes on his way while Felix rests. The Reflexed Beast-Soother spell no longer exists. If Rudolph meets another animal, he’s on his own, though Felix may still be observing any action with his Wizard Eye.

Blocking spells and Missile spells cannot be Reflexed; other spells can be."

description="The subject’s perceptions are addled. He is completely convinced that one thing that is not present is (or vice versa); he can see it, hear it, feel it, and so on. This is similar to an illusion in some ways, but it exists entirely in the mind of the subject.

The hallucination must concern the presence or absence of a single “thing”: one person the subject knows or knew, one crowd of revelers, one pair of shackles on the subject’s wrists, one pride of lions... If it can be described as a single entity in English (without amazing gymnastics), then it should pass. The GM’s judgment is final, as usual.

The hallucination does not require concentration: the subject supplies, unconsciously, all the “realism” necessary.

description="Like Hallucination, but the subject’s entire environment can be falsified. He might see himself stranded on a cliffside, in a crowded city street, in the middle of a lake, etc. The only limits are the fiendishness of the caster’s imagination and the judgment of the GM.

For any significant changes to occur in the subject’s new surroundings, concentration on the part of the caster is required, as per Hallucination. If the caster dramatically changes the subject’s perceptions, the subject may be given a new resistance roll, at the GM’s option.

Example: the subject is “placed” on top of a giant pillar of stone over a lake of molten lava. By concentrating, the caster could cause the pillar to begin sinking or bucking beneath the subject’s feet, or cause a flying monster to appear. If the caster suddenly decided that the lava turned into a green meadow, however, the subject would get a new Resistance roll.

This spell can be used for positive effect; if the subject is required to walk a narrow log across a thousand-foot-deep chasm, he might find it easier if the log spans only a shallow streambed..."

If there are several beings already aboard when the spell is cast, roll a Quick Contest of Will to see who gets control; the caster (if aboard) gets a +5 bonus to this roll. If the pilot leaves the carpet, roll another quick contest of Will between the remaining passengers to see who gets control.

The carpet’s maximum Move is equal to the caster’s effective skill, and it can handle 1 G turns without skill rolls being necessary (GURPS Basic Set, p. 466). Use the Piloting (Contragravity) skill (GURPS Basic Set, p. 214) to control the carpet.

In general, a rider cannot fall from a flying carpet unless he jumps off deliberately or is knocked off by an obstacle (such as a tree branch) or attack; the carpet keeps its riders safely on board through a combination of magic and deft maneuvering. A flying carpet does not bank sharply, fold, or bend; the spell specifically provides a stable, level platform (which makes flying through narrow gaps rather hard). Any rider engaged in strenuous activity such as fighting must make a DX roll every turn to avoid falling off (the GM may modify this roll depending on the activity). In all other respects, treat anyone fighting from a flying carpet as being on the ground (ignore the special rules for flying combatants on GURPS Basic Set, p. 548). Characters aiming a missile weapon from a moving carpet can only take the Acc bonus; aiming for extra turns gives no further bonus. Of course, someone fighting from a flying broom or chair would be subject to the usual penalties for being seated (GURPS Basic Set, p. 547).

Generous GMs may stipulate that, after the caster cancels the spell, the conveyance remains airborne for 2d+2 seconds, wobbling more with every passing moment. This sometimes allows a safe, if bumpy, landing."

This spell can only be cast on a point in space or on the ground, not on objects or creatures. A small pile of loose objects, dust, dead leaves, small insects, etc., usually forms at the borders."

If the caster spends half the energy cost, the spirit takes one second to break out of the trap; this is a bad deal, but sometimes buying even a second is a worthwhile thing to do. If multiple spirits are trapped in a single container, add half the others’ ST and IQ to the full ST and IQ of the most powerful spirit before calculating cost.

The spirit cannot damage the container or affect anything outside of it, nor can it use shape-shifting powers to help it escape in any way. It can communicate with anyone within a yard or so of the container in the normal fashion."

item="—"
description="This is actually four separate spells. Steal Might steals the subject’s ST, Steal Grace steals DX, Steal Wisdom steals IQ, and Steal Vigor steals HT. Each spell must be studied separately, but all four work identically.

The spell transfers basic attributes on a level-for-level basis to the caster from the subject (who must be a living, sapient being). The caster cannot lower the subject’s attribute below the subject’s racial average (10 for a human). Thus, a subject must have an exceptional score for this spell to work. Secondary characteristics are affected by the attribute loss.

The caster must touch the subject and hold on to him for the entire casting time; neither can do anything while the spell is being cast. The caster increases his own attribute (whichever applies) as if he had spent the character points stolen from the subject.

Example: Rolfe, with an IQ of 14, wishes to steal the wisdom of a victim with IQ 13 (this is legal; it is assumed that any character has knowledge and experiences that would expand the capabilities of another, even if the score is lower). If he drains the subject to IQ 10, he has stolen 3 levels of IQ, raising his IQ to 17."

The caster gains the skill as if he had himself spent the character points stolen from the subject. This spell can be used to steal spells.

If the victim had other skills based on the stolen one, he retains them fully, but the loss of a prerequisite causes a -2 penalty to skill use.

Example: Severin wishes to sell some ill-gotten gains, but lacks much in the way of business sense. To remedy this, he casts Steal Skill on the first bazaar merchant he passes, taking his Merchant skill. The merchant has IQ 10, Business Acumen 2, and Merchant-15, having spent 12 points on Merchant. Severin gains Merchant as if he had spent 12 points on the skill – with Severin’s IQ of 14, his Merchant skill is now 17. He does not gain the benefit of the merchant’s Business Acumen Talent."

Others must roll vs. (IQ + Magic Resistance) every second, or use Mage Sight, to avoid losing their way and walking in randomly chosen directions, unless they have a guide. Absolute Direction avoids this problem.

A Fright Check is also required of intruders first entering the mist, and again every 5 minutes. Anyone failing the first Fright Check will be very reluctant to enter! Dangerous animals simply avoid the mist, but suffer normal effects if for some reason they must enter it.

Those “native” to the mist have a +1 to their defense rolls when attacked by interlopers, and interlopers have a -1 to their own defense rolls against “natives.”

On a critical failure during casting, a demon enters the machine. It then attempts to kill its summoner and anyone else it can reach.

It obeys the caster’s orders faithfully, but otherwise has free will (also, true to its nature, a computer spirit can be infuriatingly literal-minded).

Computer spirits often have quirky personalities all their own. They remember what happens each time they are awakened; the time in between awakenings is one of slumber, not nonexistence.

If a critical failure is rolled the first time a given computer is awakened, its spirit is malicious and evil, and seeks to do harm to the caster and anyone else it can hurt.

description="Turns the caster into a power conduit, a link between an active power source and a device in need of it. The spell has two “subjects”: the source and the sink. The range penalty is based on the total distance from source to caster plus caster to sink. If either the source or the sink is not visible to the caster, the roll is at -5; if neither is visible, the roll is at -10!

A device may draw power through one mage or circle of mages at a time; if several mages are competing to supply a device, roll a Quick Contest of Skill between casters, adjusting for range.

The maximum power a mage may safely serve as a conduit for is (HT) x (Magery squared)/4, in megawatts. Thus, a wizard with HT 10 and Magery 2 could handle a steady stream of 10 x (2 x 2)/4, or 10 megawatts, safely. If a mage’s safe level is exceeded, every second he must take 1 fatigue per excess MW (or fraction thereof) and roll vs. HT. On a failed roll, he loses HP equal to the fatigue loss for that turn. On a critical failure, he suffers a heart attack (see Mortal Conditions, GURPS Basic Set, p. 429) and collapses.

A source for this spell need not be a source of electricity or some other energetic essence; particularly in its low-TL versions, Conduct Power may tap into mechanical energy from natural sources. However, a power source must be in a form that could be directly used by a machine; thus, a water wheel would be a viable source, but a waterfall would not be.

Example: The spell could be cast on the fusion plant in a starship (the source) and a blaster pistol in the mage’s hand (the sink). While the spell is maintained, the fusion plant powers the pistol. If the blaster is in the mage’s hand and the plant is 3 yards beneath the catwalk he is standing on, the total distance is 3 yards, for a -3 range penalty. If the catwalk obscures the mage’s view of the power plant, he is at a further -5 (note that the caster need not be looking at the power plant while firing the gun – just while casting the spell!)."

The whirlpool has a “funnel” in its center, the radius of which (at the surface) may be up to half that of the whirlpool. The depth of the funnel may be up to twice the radius of the whirlpool. The funnel gets progressively narrower as one nears its bottom.

The outermost yard of the whirlpool moves at Move 1, the next inner ring at Move 2 and so on. Anyone caught in the whirlpool will be dragged towards its bottom; a Swimming roll, at a penalty equal to the current ring’s speed, must be made every revolution to avoid being dragged into the next inner ring (in addition to the usual consequences for failure – GURPS Basic Set, p. 354). A success by 3 or more means the swimmer managed to move outward one ring (if he so wills).

The whirlpool has little effect on beings and objects weighing more than 90 pounds times its radius in yards. While in the whirlpool, all DX-based skills (except aquatic ones such as Swimming or Scuba) are at -5, above and beyond any penalty for being in water in the first place."

The caster may question the summoned elemental, request a service, etc. The elemental immediately makes a reaction roll to see how it feels about the wizard.

Anyone this spell injures must also roll vs. HT.

Modifiers: -1 per full five points of injury; +1 for ordinary earplugs, or +5 for Protected Hearing. Failure inflicts a Hearing penalty equal to margin of failure; failure by 10+, or critical failure, causes deafness. Either effect lasts (20 - HT) minutes, minimum one minute. After that, roll vs. HT each turn to recover. Critical failure on a recovery roll indicates a permanent injury (Duration of Crippling Injuries, GURPS Basic Set, p. 422): Hard of Hearing if the penalty was -1 to -9, Deafness if deafness occurred. Protected Hearing cuts duration to two seconds and makes recovery automatic. Any failure on the initial HT roll also stuns the victim; roll vs. HT each turn to recover.

The caster does not control the path – each yard, roll for Scatter (GURPS Basic Set, p. 414) to determine the direction moved.

Anyone the tornado would touch may attempt to dive for cover (GURPS Basic Set, p. 377) to get out of its path. Other active defenses are ineffective. Success means that person ends up on the ground, unharmed. The tornado can sweep over a victim repeatedly, doing damage with each pass. If that happens, diving for cover is useful just once.

Those who fail to get out of the way are pummeled with a 2d crushing attack; this is large-area injury (GURPS Basic Set, p. 400). Use double damage to calculate the amount of knockback, and Scatter to determine its direction.

Water offers no refuge – it’s teeming with jellyfish, leeches, stinging echinoderms, and other horrors. Everyone on the ground or swimming in the area is engulfed and attacked. No active defense roll is allowed.

Clothing (DR 0 garments) protects completely against the pests for two turns; armor (DR 1+) protects for five. After that, DR becomes irrelevant and the victim suffers 1d-1 toxic injury per turn in the area, halved (round down) on a successful HT roll. Resistant to Poison aids this HT roll, while Immunity to Poison or Sealed prevents harm.

Unlike a mundane swarm, this one doesn’t move on its own. By taking a Concentrate maneuver, however, the caster can shift the area along the ground at Move 2 (though not change its shape) to chase victims or torment new ones.

Also unlike a mundane swarm, this one is unaffected by damage. For the spell’s duration, new creepy-crawlers appear within the area to replace slain ones. People who leave the area bring vermin with them; these can be killed. Fleeing victims continue to count as exposed until the spell ends or they inflict 15 HP of injury on their passengers; see Attacking a Swarm (GURPS Basic Set, p. 461). Reentering or being overtaken by the area means starting all over again!

Example: An armored orc is caught within a Creeping Plague. He flees immediately, so he’s only in the swarm for one turn. He begins swatting (2 HP/turn) and stomping (1 HP/turn) at the pests on him; after four turns, he’s inflicted 12 HP. While he’s flapping and hopping, the caster moves the spell back onto him, so on his sixth turn, not only is he exposed for long enough that he starts to take injury (armor protects for five turns), but his efforts count for naught. If he flees again, he’ll need five more turns to deal 15 HP, during which time he’ll suffer toxic injury every second."

description="This insidious Deathtouch variant affects multiple subjects in succession. When cast, its energy cost is spent immediately but held in a “reserve.” Keep track of this, marking off three energy points each time the spell inflicts injury. When the reserve is empty, the spell ends.

The initial victim touched suffers what appears to be a standard 3d Deathtouch, but also becomes a “carrier.” Anybody that person touches without deliberate hostile intent suffers 3d Deathtouch and becomes a carrier, too. This goes on until the spell exhausts its reserve. While energy remains, all carriers remain carriers – one subject could affect any number of others. Only the living or undead take injury, but anyone can be a carrier! However, nobody can be zapped more than once by a given casting of Plague Touch.

For this spell’s purposes, a “touch” includes a deliberate touch (e.g., to render first aid or cast a helpful spell), an accidental bump (as from knockback), or even handing off an object. A person simply passing through a non-hostile hex must roll vs. DX, with failure indicating a brief touch. It’s unimportant which party initiates contact. Opponents in battle are assumed hostile; the magic won’t spread to them under any circumstances.

Counterspell and Dispel Magic can negate Plague Touch, but only for carriers they’re cast on. Plague Touch resists separately for each victim. If any trace of the spell remains, it can continue to wreak havoc.

This spell is most useful against low-IQ foes who attack in tightly packed hordes, like zombies. However, creative users can exploit it in other ways; e.g., by corralling enemies into contact and then casting it."

For as long as the spell endures, all beings with minds – friend or foe, everybody but the caster – suffer 1 HP of toxic injury per second while in the area. This injury bypasses all DR save for that specifically effective against psionic attacks. As the pulse is psionic rather than magical (only the caster is affected by magic), it ignores Magic Resistance, is unaffected by countermagic such as Spell Shield, and can penetrate no-mana areas.

In campaigns that use GURPS Psionic Powers, abilities based on Psi Static block this spell, while those that give DR against psionics (notably Psychic Armor) work normally. GURPS Psi-Tech gadgets that provide similar effects are likewise effective. Where such things work using a resistance roll, use the caster’s effective skill vs. that of the psionic ability or device."

description="Triggers a massive, momentary shock that lifts anyone on the ground five yards into the air. On landing, they suffer falling damage from that height. Typically, the ground or floor counts as a hard object, meaning 2d crushing for people with HP 8-12, increasing by +1d per full +5 HP (3d at HP 13-17, 4d at HP 18-22, ...). For details, see Collisions and Falls (GURPS Basic Set, p. 430-431).

If the ceiling is lower than five yards, damage is instead as for two falls: one from an effective (5 - ceiling height) yards for smashing into the hard ceiling, and another from ceiling height for crashing to the floor afterward.

A successful Acrobatics roll reduces effective falling distance by five yards. Thus, it’s possible to avoid all damage from hitting the ground. This doesn’t mitigate damage from being slammed into the ceiling first, however!

In all cases, Hit Location from a Fall (GURPS Basic Set, p. 431) applies. Injury is not large-area, but all armor counts as “flexible” against this damage.

Landing location is random. On a combat map, pick up each affected figure and drop it from 5” up. Upon landing, victims capable of standing may make a DX or Acrobatics roll at -3 to land on their feet.

Example: A victim with HP 15 is standing in a two-yard-high tunnel; smashing into the ceiling is equivalent to a fall of 3 yards. First they slam into the ceiling, then they drop two yards to the floor. With DR 2 armor, injury is applied normally. Outdoors, arcing up five yards and landing would inflict greater damage, potentially crippling a limb.
Seismic Shock also causes general chaos. Objects that require checks for breakage if dropped must roll for breakage, people taking Aim or Concentrate maneuvers must make Will rolls for distraction, those engaged in long actions must roll vs. the relevant skill or start over, and machinery requires a HT roll to avoid breakdown. For targets not securely anchored to the ground, these rolls are at an extra -3.

This spell has no effect on targets not in contact with the ground."

description="This Great Wish variant can do but one thing: wreak widespread destruction. Instead of making 1,000 energy available to cast one spell automatically, the full 2,000 energy is available – but only to do harm. Each energy point inflicts 1 HP of injury, and the wish-maker can divide this among any number of people or objects in line of sight. The effect cannot be resisted, and DR is of no benefit.

The wish-maker must specify the effective damage type, which has to be the same for all targets. This counts only for the purpose of exploiting disadvantages and limitations; it causes no special damage effects (e.g., “burning” doesn’t set fires). The injury is also considered magical, where relevant.

Example: Marge the Barbarian is surrounded by 20 trolls that have HP 20, Unkillable 3 with Achilles’ Heel vs. burning and corrosion damage, and Regeneration ineffective against the same. Bad odds, even for a barbarian, so she decides to use her tribe’s prized Doom Wish item on them. Not knowing the trolls’ exact HP, she inflicts equal injury on them all: 100 HP apiece. Knowing trolls as she does, she specifies burning injury. All 20 trolls drop to -4xHP and need four HT rolls to avoid death. Any reaching -5xHP due to prior wounds die automatically – and any survivors can’t regenerate the lost HP.

This is not a death spell in the GURPS Magic: Death Spells sense, but a big dose of injury. While DR is ineffective, other traits can prevent death if the user chooses badly; e.g., if Marge picked crushing injury, the trolls’ Unkillable would keep them alive and they’d regenerate. Foes with Injury Tolerance (Damage Reduction) (GURPS Powers, pp. 53, 118-119) may require two or more times the “obvious” amount of injury to slay. Against one victim, this spell is nearly always fatal. Then again, a standard Great Wish could kill almost anybody with an irresistible 1,000-energy casting!

As with Great Wish, this spell can never be learned at a level better than 15, and any failure when casting it costs the caster and each helper a level of IQ and 6d injury. On a critical failure, injury is 6d or 2,000 HP divided by the number of ritualists, whichever is worse (on average the latter, unless there are more than 95 participants)."

description="Imbues a handheld item – traditionally but not necessarily a staff – with the one-time ability to explode when broken. Accidental breakage never sets off the blast, although it does end the enchantment. The trigger is much more specific!

To blow up the item, the wielder must grasp it with one or more hands (not remotely, as via a Movement spell or Telekinesis), declare the intention to activate it, and take one second – a maneuver in combat – to destroy it. Dashing it against something hard and immovable counts as an attack, deals the object maximum swing damage for the user’s ST, and can benefit from All-Out Attack (Strong). Snapping it is considered a Ready maneuver, involves winning a Quick Contest of (ST - artifact’s DR) vs. (artifact’s HP), and can involve extra effort. A spell such as Shatter must be cast by touch using the usual Concentrate maneuver(s).

Alternatively, if the item is broken by enemy action while in the owner’s hands – e.g., by an attack powerful enough to shatter it when used to parry (Parrying Heavy Weapons, GURPS Basic Set, p. 376), or by a hostile artillery spell – the wielder can attempt to initiate the blast with a simple Will roll.

However the blast is triggered, it’s a crushing explosion that does 6d x square root of (object weight in lbs. x 4) damage. For instance, a 1-lb. baton (“wand”) does 6dx2 cr ex, while a 4-lb. quarterstaff detonates for 6dx4 cr ex. The holder always suffers this damage – there’s no workaround – while everyone else divides damage by distance in yards from the holder (not triple that). Average damage from an exploding quarterstaff (84 points) could easily kill everyone within four yards (84/4 = 21 points)."

Treat this as a five-yard (velocity 10) fall, usually onto a hard surface; see Collisions and Falls (GURPS Basic Set, p. 430-431). This deals 2d crushing to victims with HP 8-12, plus an extra 1d per +5 HP; e.g., 3d at HP 13-17.

It’s possible to be wise enough to recognize illusion magic, resolute enough to reflexively disbelieve conjured entities, or canny enough to know when sight, sound, and scent don’t agree.

Subjects who resist see their illusionary foes fizzle instantly. Those who fail now face shadowy versions of themselves. Each victim’s opponent appears directly ahead – a yard away if possible, in close combat if not – and attacks much as a Phantom spell would. It can strike, grapple, etc. as if real. Combat stats are identical to the subject’s, but ST and DX cannot exceed the mage’s skill with the spell, which can limit damage, Basic Speed, Move, skills, active defenses, etc.

Example: Mirror, Mirror is cast at skill 16. An ogre with ST 20 and DX 9 would face a phantom ogre with DX 9 but just ST 16, which would mean less damage. A ninja with ST 11 and DX 17 would face a phantom ninja with ST 11 but only DX 16, and therefore lower Basic Speed, skill, and defenses.

As with Phantom, this entity doesn’t have DR or HP, or suffer normal injury. Instead, it has a damage threshold equal to the caster’s margin of success. Any single attack on the phantom that inflicts this amount (or more) of basic damage immediately dispels it; lesser attacks accomplish nothing.

Materialized phantoms have substance for everyone. Thus, anybody may attack one. However, a given phantom only ever attacks its designated victim, maneuvering to stay close to its target. If that person is knocked out or killed, their shadow-self is dispelled – the entity doesn’t stick around to fight others.

This spell doesn’t produce a persistent effect on the area. It affects only subjects there at the instant of casting. The phantoms it creates can move beyond the area to pursue their designated victims until dispelled or the spell ends, however. The entities called up by this spell are already extraordinarily autonomous and cannot be further enhanced with Independence or Initiative.

Subjects with suitable ready weapons take Attack or Ready maneuvers to use these on themselves. The GM decides what’s “suitable” in the space of a turn. It’s plausible to cut oneself with a blade, shoot oneself with a gun or crossbow, arm a grenade and hold on to it, or deliberately mishandle a Missile spell or Molotov cocktail. Falling upon a 15’ pike or turning a longbow around fails a reality check.

If a suitable weapon is to hand, skip attack and defense rolls; just roll damage against the torso. Attacks must use the deadliest attack mode, if there’s a choice (GM’s decision, remembering that the target is the torso) – and no “pulling punches.” Anyone who can Fast-Draw a weapon (or a better weapon) does so; e.g., a barehanded fighter with a knife Fast-Draws it and starts cutting, while someone holding a knife and wearing a sheathed sword drops the knife, Fast-Draws the sword, and falls on that.

Subjects without suitable weapons do something else that’s liable to get them killed. They might use Move to run as close as possible to the nearest enemy; if several foes are equidistant, choose one at random. If a hazard – lava pit, cliff, persistent artillery spell, etc. – is closer, they’ll hurl themselves at that instead. In either case, they choose to let their guard down: no active defenses, DX rolls not to fall in, or anything similar."

Those who fail to resist must use their next combat maneuver to attack the nearest ally (never an enemy or neutral party); if several are equidistant, choose one at random. Subjects with no allies on the battlefield are unaffected.

A subject with a ready ranged attack (bow, spear, Missile spell, death gaze, etc.) uses it, usually meaning an Attack maneuver. One with only melee attacks chooses Attack if the nearest ally is within one step, All-Out Attack (Strong) if the target is farther away but within half Move forward, or Move and Attack if those options are impossible. A subject who can’t attack the nearest ally in one turn prepares to do so, dropping a melee weapon to Ready a ranged one, using Concentrate to cast a Missile spell, or – if without a ranged attack – taking a full Move toward the chosen target.

Movement is always as direct as possible, without regard for battle formations or who ends up behind whom.

Subjects suffer unavoidable penalties for their attacks (e.g., distance and visibility for ranged attacks, or the Move and Attack penalty), but won’t take optional penalties for hit location, Deceptive Attack, Rapid Strike, etc. unless final skill would be 16+. Similarly, they won’t try to “spoil” attacks by, for instance, taking Move and Attack if they could Attack, or shifting their weapon to the off hand. For one turn, they truly want to kill their allies.

Attacks must likewise be as damaging as possible, never “pulling punches,” always choosing the Strong option if making an All-Out Attack, and using the deadliest attack mode or weapon (GM’s decision) if there’s a choice. Anyone who can Fast-Draw a better weapon does so; e.g., someone holding a dagger and wearing a holstered pistol drops the blade, Fast-Draws the gun, and shoots. If this means expending a one-shot item (even a Doom Wish, GURPS Magic: Artillery Spells, p. 13-14), expensive Missile spell, or limited-use ability, too bad!

Targets of these attacks may defend normally if they see them coming. Attacks from allies are likely to come from the back (no defense) or side (-2 to defend), however.

This spell is no cheaper than Mass Mutilation (GURPS Magic: Artillery Spells, p. 20). Though it’s likely to cause fewer casualties – not everyone is guaranteed to have an ally to attack, and active defenses are permitted – it’s more likely to scatter enemy formations and more useful against foes that can’t easily harm themselves (wielding long weapons, immune to their own attacks, etc.)."

At its center, the pull’s ST equals twice the energy points in the spell; each yard of distance reduces ST by one. The moment the spell is cast, animate beings nearby must roll a Quick Contest: their ST vs. the spell’s. Those who weigh more than 20 lbs. times the spell’s ST – that’s 20 lbs. x (ST-1) at one yard, 20 lbs. x (ST-2) at two yards, and so on – are unaffected. There’s no time to grab anything, but people already hanging onto any person or object (see below) the spell cannot affect may add +2 ST per hand used, while anyone grappled by a foe too heavy to budge rolls only if their rival chooses to let them go. Losing the Contest means being yanked into the center; victims and their possessions are pulled (or not) as a unit. There’s no fixed Move as with Pull – everything arrives at high speed!

Don’t roll Contests for inanimate objects. They’re pulled to the center unless they are fixed in place or weigh more than 20 lbs. times the spell’s ST. The GM is encouraged to simplify; e.g., in a quarry, all that’s important is that some rocks move.

If there are no movable objects nearby and just one victim, the only effect is being hauled into the center. If there are two or more people and/or solid objects, though, they crash together at the center, much as if hurled by Poltergeist (Magic, p. 144). Don’t work out detailed collision damage from speed and HP – damage is a flat 2d+2 crushing for everyone involved (and important objects). This is large-area injury (GURPS Basic Set, p. 400).

After the collision, victims are clustered around the center. On a battle map, the GM may position them in the center hex or adjacent hexes. Combatants retain their original facings, but those whose injuries haven’t caused them to fall down must roll against the highest of DX, Acrobatics, or Judo to avoid falling down."

The caster’s magical strength – not physical might – determines damage.

Everybody in the area is attacked each turn, on their turn, at skill 15. The victim can try a Hearing roll at -2 to detect the weapon’s whine; success permits any active defense, while failure allows only a dodge. All defenses are at -4 for an unseen attacker. Also roll 1d for the attack’s origin: 1-3 is front, 4 is right-hand side (another -2 to defend), 5 is behind (no defense), and 6 is left-hand side (-2 to defend).

A hit damages a random hit location. Use the weapon’s usual swung cutting attack as if swung with ST 15, for a basic swing damage of 2d+1.

It’s possible to break or grab the animated weapon. This requires a Hearing roll at -2 first. Success allows an attack on the blade at a basic -6 plus the usual -3 to -5 for weapon size (see Striking at Weapons, GURPS Basic Set, p. 400). The weapon cannot defend. Breaking it ends the spell. Grabbing it doesn’t; it may try to break free each turn with ST 15.

The caster can animate several weapons at once: a blade in either hand, even a fistful of knives (one hand can hold weapons weighing up to BL). Find energy cost from total weight. This doesn’t give more attacks or damage. It does mean that disabling a single weapon won’t prevent attacks, and it may increase the odds of a hit: add the bonus under Rapid Fire (GURPS Basic Set, p. 373) to skill, reading “shots” as “weapons.” If the weapons aren’t alike, choose which hits each target – or is neutralized by enemy action – at random.

Example: A wizard animates six small knives (total 3 lbs.): two fine-quality and four good-quality. This makes base cost 6. The knives have skill 15 +1 (for six knives) = 16. A hit has a 2 in 6 chance of inflicting swing-3 +1 (for fine quality), or 2d-1 cutting and a 4 in 6 chance of 2d-2 cutting. Two must be neutralized to reduce skill to 15, and all six to prevent attacks.

Attempts to battle the entities this spell conjures are pointless – the magic brings a steady stream of spirits that partially materialize where the victim cannot see them, take a “bite,” and then vanish into the Spirit World.

These spring from soil like ordinary plants, appear as though shaped from a wooden floor, force their way up between bricks or cobbles, and create cracks in porous stone or concrete. Only seamless, nonporous ground in the area – like a sheet of metal, glass, or plastic flooring – remains unaffected.

Each turn, everybody on foot in an Ironweed field automatically steps on one spike plus one per yard traveled within the area. Falling down among the barbs means being stabbed SM+4 times; e.g., four times for an SM 0 human or five for an SM +1 ogre. There are no rolls to avoid these fates – the shoots are too closely packed!

Each sprout does thrust-3 impaling damage, based on the victim’s ST, to a randomly chosen foot – or, on a fall, to a random hit location. Minimum basic impaling damage is 1 point per attack (GURPS Basic Set, p. 378). Any DR protects normally. Impaling damage isn’t doubled against limbs or extremities (such as the feet); see GURPS Basic Set, p. 399. Maximum injury is 2 HP per barb, but keep track of it – accumulated wounds (GURPS Basic Set, p. 420) can cripple.

Example: An ogre with ST 21 (thrust 2d), DR 3 skin, and DR 2 boots runs three yards through the area. That means being stabbed 1 + 3 = 4 times in the feet. Each shoot does 2d-3 imp vs. DR 5; a roll of 9 or more on the dice is needed to get past DR, but even a roll of 11 or 12 inflicts just 2 HP. A typical ST 10 (thrust 1d-2) peasant without DR would suffer 1d-5 imp each time – or 1 HP per barb, with minimum impaling damage.

While easy to learn, cheap, long-lasting, and not very damaging, this spell is artillery. A caster with a lot of energy could blanket the entire battlefield and bloodily cripple all DR 0 fodder in a few turns with little inconvenience to armored allies."

If the casting leaves the (former!) magician with unspent FP or Energy Reserve that could have powered the spell, add 1d to the blast per full 10 energy points.

Everyone within five yards also risks being hit by bones, teeth, shattered gear, and so on, for 1d cutting damage; see Fragmentation Damage (GURPS Basic Set, pp. 414-415).

The caster is reduced to -10xHP regardless of damage inflicted, and cannot be resurrected – there isn’t enough left. The fate of gear is up to the GM. Most equipment is destroyed, but for anything important, assess damage against DR and HP.

Morally and theologically, treat this spell as the equivalent of any kamikaze – one person’s sacrifice to slay legitimate enemies is another’s terrorist act.

On the caster’s next turn, the dome shrinks out of existence. Magical creatures inside it – anything Pentagram (GURPS Magic, pp. 124-125) could affect, including creations, demons, elementals, golems, spirits, and undead – are unaffected as the moving surface of force washes past them. But everybody else in the dome is dragged into the center, regardless of ST.

Unlike Black Sphere (GURPS Magic: Death Spells, p. 20), this isn’t an instant-death effect – at some point, the dome’s contents push back forcefully enough to break the spell. Still, it isn’t healthy: Everyone remaining in the area suffers 4d crushing damage as large-area injury (GURPS Basic Set, p. 400).

The GM decides how cramped things get before the dome expires, as well as where people end up. On a battle map, five human-sized victims per hex works. The number of hexes in radius R is 3xR² − 3xR + 1, so if matters, final radius ends up being one yard for up to five victims, two yards for up to 35, three yards for up to 95, and so on. Multi-hex figures count as one victim per hex of size, and may be forced into unnatural positions. Anybody crushed into the same hex as a being with Spines or an Aura is affected.

This spell is cheap to cast because for small areas, it’s unlikely to catch many victims unless the battlefield itself is restrictive – everybody who can leave will!"

description="Creates a miniature Force Dome in one hand that can be hurled at an enemy. This has Acc 2 and Max 80, but no 1/2D. Roll against Innate Attack (Projectile) to hit. On striking its target, the ball delivers a crushing blow – much like Ice Sphere or Stone Missile – and then pushes off from its target, leading to two important differences.

First, this doubles damage for knockback purposes only; e.g., a hit that does 14 points of crushing damage would do knockback as for 28 points. Knockback pushes the victim away along the line of fire.

Second, if the missile hits, it regains some energy and ricochets toward a new enemy of the caster – the foe closest to the previous victim’s location prior to knockback. The ball is now guided by magic; roll against the wizard’s Force Ball level rather than Innate Attack skill. The only modifiers that matter are range penalties for the distance between targets and -5 if the trajectory crosses low mana; the projectile ignores poor visibility and steers deftly around obstructions.

The secondary target is hit for 1d less damage, still doubled for knockback – and then the ball seeks out the nearest foe it hasn’t attacked yet. This continues until the missile fails an attack roll, runs out of new targets, reaches zero dice of damage, or travels a total of 80 yards in its quest for enemies, whereupon it expires.

Those hit by a Force Ball may dodge or block. Success prevents damage but doesn’t stop the missile from ricocheting toward someone else.

Example: Juniper has Innate Attack-14 and Force Ball-16, and hurls a 6d Force Ball at an orc three yards away; she has skill 14 - 1 (range) = 13, rolls a 12, and hits. The orc fails to defend, and suffers 20 points of crushing damage, which counts as 40 points for knockback. The spell is now at 5d, and the next-nearest enemy is two yards away (no range penalty); the spell rolls to hit at 16 and succeeds. This continues for two more attacks on other orcs two yards apart, for 4d and 3d damage; one dodges and one doesn’t, but there are no misses.

After that, the only foes not yet attacked are some archers 25 yards away. The missile still has enough damage (2d) and range (total range is 34 yards), but attacks at -7 for distance; the spell has skill 16 - 7 = 9, rolls an 11, and misses, so it dissipates instead of seeking another target."

The subject is also the caster, who must be able to shriek and not Mute (Cannot Speak is fine), gagged, or silenced by a spell such as Garble, Hush, or Strike Dumb.

While the capacity to wail in this way is magical, the sonic effect is not. It can cross no-mana areas but requires a path from caster to target through a fluid medium (e.g., air or water) – that is, if the wizard were hollering normally, the shouts would have to be audible at that person’s location. The victim needn’t hear the howl, however; deafness, earplugs, etc. afford no protection. Withering Wail must win a Quick Contest against Silence or Wall of Silence to cross such areas.

description="Shoots a particle beam with Acc 3 and Max 50, but no 1/2D, that has the potential to affect everything along its line of fire. Choose a primary target and roll a standard ranged attack, using Innate Attack (Beam). Hit or miss, draw a line from the attacker, through the target, out to 50 yards: Everything else on that line is also attacked, at the lower of the roll the caster would need to hit or 9 less.

This beam is broad enough to inflict large-area injury (GURPS Basic Set, p. 400) and sufficiently penetrating that DR protects at only 1/5 value. As a consequence, targets normally don’t provide cover DR to one another – everything hit takes full damage. However, the ray will stop if it strikes something that has both SM +2 or more and cover DR equal to or greater than five times maximum damage.

Example: Alecks shoots a 6d(5) Death Ray at an orc 10 yards away (-4 to hit); he has Innate Attack (Beam) at 15, and needs 11 or less. The orcish hordes are arranged in six ranks two yards apart, so there are five more potential targets at 12 (-5 to hit), 14 (-5), 16 (-6), 18 (-6), and 20 (-6) yards. The rolls needed to hit these foes on purpose are 10 or less for the first two, 9 or less for the next three, so the beam attacks them all at 9 or less. Just behind the last rank is a foot-thick dungeon wall with cover DR 13 per inch (GURPS Basic Set, p. 559), or DR 156 – large enough to stop the ray but not durable enough, as five times maximum damage is 180. Beyond the wall is an orcish chieftain, at 48 yards (-8 to hit), just inside Max 50; the beam has a 7 or less chance of hitting him as well!

Despite being a Radiation spell, Death Ray does not inflict rads. It is still hard on electronics, though, and has the Surge modifier (GURPS Basic Set, p. 105) just like a Lightning spell."

The only things not affected are metal, stone, glass, deliberate fireproofing, anything soaked with water, and anything high in moisture, like flesh, green wood, or (obviously) water.

In principle, those affected might never know. In practice, anybody carrying open flame (candle, torch, flaming arrow, ready matchlock, etc.), smoking, striking flame (say, to light a torch, cigar, or low-tech grenade), hit by a fire attack (weapon or spell that does burning damage), or touched to fire (e.g., lit match, Ignite Fire, or Create Fire) catches fire unless nothing carried was affected. Being in the same hex with somebody who’s ablaze can set fire to those whose gear is altered by this spell; roll vs. DX to avoid contact. Use standard active defenses against fire attacks, hurled Zippos, attempts to touch someone with fire, etc.

The effects of being on fire are explained in Catching Fire (GURPS Basic Set, p. 434). These flames are exceptionally violent, doing 1d burn per second, like a Molotov cocktail or a fantasy oil flask (GURPS Basic Set, p. 411) rather than the usual 1d-1. If everything burning is worn or carried outside fireproof armor, armor DR protects – but if clothing, or cloth or leather armor, is involved, it doesn’t. Equipment burns itself out in 10d seconds if not extinguished.

Though not direct artillery, this works much as if it were. Flicking a match into a close-packed group – or tagging the area with a quick Create Fire – is all it takes to do massive damage.

description="Shoots a lightning bolt with Acc 3 and Max 100 – but no 1/2D – that arcs to multiple targets. To fire it at the first target, make an ordinary ranged attack using Innate Attack (Projectile). The victim may block or dodge.

On a miss or a dodge, roll to see if the bolt hits someone else; see Hitting the Wrong Target (GURPS Basic Set, pp. 389-390) and Overshooting and Stray Shots (GURPS Basic Set, p. 390). If it hits something that’s rooted in place (floor, wall, pillar, flagpole, tree, etc.), it damages that object and “grounds out.” If it travels its full 100 yards without a hit, it’s wasted.

However, if the bolt hits someone who isn’t rooted in place – regardless of whether that’s the intended target – and that person either fails to defend (and takes damage) or successfully blocks (and doesn’t), the bolt arcs! A block prevents damage but not arcing.

An arcing bolt loses 1d-1 damage and attacks the valid target nearest the previous victim. Targets rooted in place aren’t valid, and neither are those already hit (they’re “ionized” and ignored) or the caster (whom the spell protects), but the bolt can’t tell friend from foe. To hit with an arcing bolt, roll against the caster’s Chain Lightning spell – not Innate Attack skill – applying only the range penalty for the distance between targets.

Handle the secondary target exactly like the primary one: A miss or a dodge lets the bolt go on without losing damage, and it may hit the wrong target (along a line between the previous and current victim in this case) at the usual maximum of 9 or less. A failed defense or a successful block causes the bolt arc to a new target with 1d-1 less damage, attacking at the wizard’s Chain Lightning level modified for distance between targets.

This continues until the lightning runs out of valid targets, reaches zero damage dice, or travels a total of 100 yards, any of which cause it to dissipate.

Example: Nell has Innate Attack-15 and Chain Lightning-17, and hurls 8d-8 of Chain Lightning at a soldier five yards away; she has skill 15 - 2 (range) = 13, rolls an 11, and hits. The warrior blocks and takes no damage; this diminishes the bolt to 7d-7. The next-nearest foe is 10 yards away (-4); the spell rolls to hit at 13 and succeeds, and that man fails his block, so he’s hit for 7d-7 of lightning damage and the bolt is reduced to 6d-6. Three yards (-1) from him are a trio of fighters standing one yard apart in a line; the spell needs 16 to hit, and does so, but the target dodges. The bolt, still at 6d-6, has a 9 or less chance of hitting the wrong target; it streaks past one warrior (a 14) but hits the next (an 8), and he tries but fails to dodge, taking 6d-6 damage and reducing the bolt to 5d-5. The bolt has 80 yards of range remaining and goes after the next target at full skill modified for range."

This is instantaneous. The wizard isn’t out of body for long enough to suffer ill effects from the round trip.

The subject’s body will live indefinitely – as a mindless shell with IQ 0 – if cared for, but the mind dissipates after a mere Will/3 seconds, rounded down. While the mind survives, it can use psi abilities, spells it knows well enough to cast without ritual, and so on, although it can perceive nothing and can touch only whatever its vessel is touching. After that time, the victim’s consciousness is gone.

In theory, magic capable of reuniting a mind and a body, or allowing a mind to enter another body, can save the subject if cast in those Will/3 seconds. However, Possession and Soul Jar take a minute, Permanent Possession requires five minutes, and Exchange Bodies needs an hour. In practice, only high-Will victims with extraordinary skill levels (for time reduction) have much hope. Dispel Possession won’t work, as the subject isn’t possessed!

This spell has an unpleasant drawback: On a critical failure, the would-be subject may place the caster’s mind and his own in his choice of the caster’s body, his own body, and some random vessel.

Subjects with IQ 6+ add (IQ - 5) to their resistance roll: HT+1 at IQ 6, HT+2 at IQ 7, and so on. Average humans, with IQ 10, resist at HT+5 and are almost immune. Almost.

Unfortunates who fail to resist are butchered like hogs and beyond Resurrection. Dead bodies can’t resist. On them, this is just a costly Prepare Game variant. It’s still sometimes used when dressing out creatures so dangerous that nobody wants to take the risk that there’s a live one among the carcasses, or where religious law requires it.

This is an inefficient death spell. Cost and resistance rise with target IQ. Even against a low-IQ predator, it’s too slow to cast while evading teeth and claws. The death effects are more an interesting thaumatological curiosity than a goal pursued by serious combat wizards."

This is a roll to resist poison, not magic – advantages that work against poison (e.g., Resistant to Poison) provide their usual benefits, but Magic Resistance does nothing!

Failure to resist means the subject suffers injury equal to the dice of effect (from 1d to 8d). If this is 2xHP or more, death occurs without a HT roll. A victim who’s poisoned but not killed suffers severe cramps, numbness, and weakness, giving -3 on all dice rolls until all lost HP are restored.

This spell can affect anyone with a physical body. Subjects who have the Duplication advantage and an unused Dupe can sacrifice one copy to ensure the survival of the rest. This is instead of trying to resist. It costs a Dupe but guarantees survival.

If this spell critically fails, the caster becomes the point of arrival for a Dimensional Dissection spell cast elsewhere in creation.

Brute-force attempts to summon him back will conjure his corpse... or, on a critical failure, a hostile ghost or demon!

This spell resembles Rift to Hell (GURPS Thaumatology: Magical Styles, p. 36), but isn’t identical. Like that spell, it’s faster and cheaper than Plane Shift Other because it’s intended for combat – and because the subject must be on the ground, and there’s always a chance that a pious or crafty victim, or one with a Destiny, will negotiate escape with TPTB. It has no limits on who it can affect, but is unpredictable against foes who aren’t truly alive, especially those from other dimensions. The details of who can return, and how easily, are campaign-specific, but the possibility is definitely a creepy supernatural drawback (GURPS Magic: Death Spells, p. 8)."

On someone who’s dying from drowning, asphyxiation, or heart attack – whether the cause is mundane or magical – a successful hit instantly restarts the heart and lungs, reviving the patient and preventing death, but healing no FP or HP. The effects are identical to a successful attempt at Resuscitation (GURPS Basic Set, p. 425).

On a living person whose heart and lungs are functioning, this spell is dangerous! The magical jolt it delivers can damage vital organs and stop the heart. It inflicts 4d of generalized injury; DR has no effect. The victim must make a HT roll at -1 per full 2 HP lost. On a failure, the subject falls unconscious for (20 - HT) minutes, minimum one minute. Failure by 5 or more, or critical failure, results in a heart attack exactly as per GURPS Basic Set, p. 429.

Resuscitate is technically a cure for some death magic, and doesn’t obey most of the guidelines in Chapter 1. However, on a healthy recipient with less than HT 13, it’s likely to result in a mortal condition. Thus, it counts as a death spell for the purposes of Stayin’ Alive (GURPS Magic: Death Spells p. 6) and Aspected Mana (GURPS Magic: Death Spells pp. 5-6)."

Casters spending this much energy usually opt to obstruct the subject’s circulation. If the victim fails to resist with HT, the result is identical to a mortal wound (GURPS Basic Set, p. 423): The target instantly falls unconscious and must roll vs. HT every 30 minutes, with any failure meaning death. At TL6+, trauma maintenance can help. Natural recovery occurs only if one of those HT rolls critically succeeds. Otherwise, surgery (roll as if the subject were at -HP), Dispel Creation (at -5 without a way to see the obstruction), or Remove Curse is needed. Neither Counterspell nor Dispel Magic is effective. A victim who recovers is at the lower of -HP or current HP.

The above is the fastest this spell can kill. Slower options (like coma) are possible, as are nonlethal ones (e.g., crippled body parts); effects vary, but the cure is identical. The condition – mortal or not – must be one that a penny-sized foreign body could cause. The GM should forbid anything that targets organs the subject lacks: mortal wounds require a heart and blood; coma, a brain; and so on."

A subject who fails to resist is instantly engulfed in a monstrous shadow, conscious but incapacitated. Over the next minute, he can do nothing but resist again each second. Victory here doesn’t end the curse but merely staves off harm; each loss drains 1 HP. If total injury from this spell (maximum 60 points) ever reaches his full HP score, he’s slain. The cause of death could be anything: a man might die of profound shock, a robot may shake itself apart, a spirit could actually be consumed by an apparition of pure mana.

Others may attempt to dispel the phantasm using Dispel Illusion (or in theory Remove Curse, though in practice that’s too slow). General countermagic – such as Counterspell or Dispel Magic – is ineffective. So are attacks on the Phantom Killer or its creator!

A failed resistance roll leads to panic similar to a roll of 33 on the Fright Check Table (GURPS Basic Set, pp. 360-361): The victim goes mad and immediately tries to kill himself to avoid the revealed fate, in the most expedient way his environment and resources allow. A knight battling a monster might bare his throat and invite Instant Death (GURPS Basic Set, p. 423), a gunslinger may 'eat a bullet,' and so on.

The most common cause of death is a freak accident or a lucky enemy hit that results in mortal wound status or reaching -5xHP against all odds and regardless of protection. There’s a world of possibilities: decapitating oneself with a Fast-Draw failure (or even a Survival failure when opening tinned rations), deadly surprise attacks triggered by blown social rolls, spontaneous combustion. If the subject is doing nothing that could lead to such an outcome, the culprit may be a mortal condition stemming from an undiagnosed flaw. Failure during physical activity might indicate a heart attack, while a failed mental task could mean stroke inflicting coma or a mortal wound.

Remove Curse can lift this spell, but there’s a risk: The wizard casting it gets one try only. Any failure counts as failure by the subject, producing a lethal backfire. The effects could resemble any of the other death spells in this collection!

As with Pestilence, Steal Vitality, and Soul Jar, the victim’s defense is “not being subdued by a necromancer” – there’s no resistance roll, though Magic Resistance penalizes the success roll.

Once the spell is cast, the subject will become a zombie slave – per the Zombie spell – in (HT - 10) minutes, minimum one minute. Resistant to Disease adds to HT, slowing the process, but even Immunity to Disease can’t stop it; that advantage merely gives +15 to HT, delaying the inevitable. Throughout the entire transformation, the victim suffers as if stricken by an Agonize spell; if unconscious, this awakens him.

The spell counts as “on” for the caster while the disease runs its course, giving -1 to cast other spells. He can end it (GURPS Basic Set, p. 237) at any time before the victim becomes a zombie, making it a useful form of torture; agony, impending death, and the threat of becoming a zombie give +6 to rolls made for coercion, including Interrogation. Terminating the spell an instant before zombification results in simple death.

Zombify can be halted by Cure Disease or Remove Curse before the subject dies. In practice, only casters with exceptional skill levels (for time reduction) rushing to save victims with high effective HT are likely to succeed. Zombify resists Cure Disease just as it would Remove Curse.

In some game worlds, this spell creates infectious zombies, and anyone they kill will rise as undead. Such zombies (even “patient zero”) are not under the caster’s control! In other settings, that version coexists with the standard one. For an in-depth exploration of different kinds of zombies and spells for creating them, see GURPS Zombies."

Anyone who fails to escape the area is affected – this is a rare death spell that can kill multiple people. Roll the spell’s effect dice (from 1d to 4d) once per victim.

However, if all the goo can be collected within a minute (doubtful if the subject was standing on anything but hard, dry ground like stone or finished wood), Remove Curse can reverse the effects. This must be cast before the stuff dies, which won’t take long in any environment that isn’t rich in rotting organic matter. The GM may require daily Biology or Naturalist rolls from the slime’s caretaker."

Most targets resist by moving fast enough to get out – use the higher of DX or twice Basic Speed. Someone capable of an active defense involving teleportation (such as the Blink spell, or the Warp advantage at -10) or insubstantiality (e.g., the Phase spell) may choose to rely on that instead; this is a resistance roll using the controlling score, not an active defense roll. Magic Resistance always subtracts from the caster’s skill, but it adds only to the subject’s DX- or Speed-based resistance.

Failure to resist is instantly lethal for all subjects. No corpse is left to resurrect, and gear is likewise gone for good. This destruction is purely physical; there’s no effect on the immortal soul."

For this spell to work, there must be a path from caster to subject through a fluid medium (e.g., air or water) – that is, if the wizard were shouting, it should be audible at the target’s location. However, the victim doesn’t have to hear the wail; considerations such as deafness or earplugs afford no protection. What is important is that the subject be alive, have IQ 6+, and possess none of Supernatural Durability, Unaging, or Unkillable. Thaumatologists claim the sound opens a spiritual portal to the realm of Death.

If the subject fails to resist, he dies on the spot. Apparent cause of death is whatever “natural causes” seem likely to end that person’s life – generalized organ failure from great age, unless the GM wants to get specific. Successful resistance means the subject survives unharmed.

Critical failure with this spell afflicts the caster with Cannot Speak (GURPS Basic Set, p. 125). Until this is bought off – which requires 15 character points – the wizard can only make horrid wailing noises and cannot cast spells known below skill 15 (see GURPS Basic Set, p. 237)."

Dissipate amounts to a death spell on anyone it affects. However, Remove Curse can reverse it if the victim’s residue is collected within a minute. As the residual matter is a liquid, Shape Water is useful here.

Any living, DR 0 creature (ignoring any DR with the Tough Skin limitation) who stops or walks through an affected hex is “stung” – branches lash out, puncture the skin, and begin drawing blood. (The blood flows down to the roots, where it is expelled into the soil. This may be of interest for vampires or dark alchemists who need special ingredients.) At the moment the branches strike, the victim is mentally stunned. Until he makes a successful IQ roll to snap out of it, he loses 1 FP per second. Anyone traveling at Move 4 or greater is too fast to be stung.

If the victim collapses from FP loss, he has a 5-in-6 chance that the fall will break his contact with the plant (GM rolls one die). If the GM rolls a 6, the victim fell into or on top of the plant; the bloodsucking branches stay connected and he continues to lose FP. Note that, once he is at 0 FP, he loses HP, as well. This is a good time for adventurers to use traits such as Luck, Serendipity, or any form of divine intervention.

If using the Density of Vegetation rules (GURPS Magic: Plant Spells, p. 6) alter the rate of FP loss as follows: Sparse (1 FP every five seconds), Normal (no change), Dense (2 FP per second), Impenetrable (3 FP per second). Impenetrable is possible only if the victim is trapped inside – or lying on top of – the plants.

A critical failure causes the plants to attack only the caster and his friends. If the caster rolls a critical success, the spell’s effects can become permanent without paying the 10 times cost."

A new filled hex has the same density as the hex from which it spread.

Plants that pile up against a fixed object do (1d x Magery) crushing damage per minute. Use the rules for structural damage on GURPS Basic Set, pp. 558-559. Movable objects are shoved as per Lifting and Moving Things (GURPS Basic Set, p. 353); BL is 15 x Magery.

Any ambulatory being can evade the expanding plant life. Those who cannot – sessile, unconscious, etc. – are shoved as inanimate objects. If pushed against a solid barrier, the shoved individual suffers 1/10 of the crushing damage inflicted each turn.

Example: A spellcaster with Magery 3 casts this in a room with wooden walls (DR 2 and 29 HP) and a moss floor, occupied by a large, 500-lb. table. The living moss pushes outward with effective BL 45, causing 3d damage. Shoving ST is 540 lbs.; the growing plants scoot the table across the floor. When they press against the wall, the GM rolls 3d, with a result of 10; this is greater than the wall’s DR 2, so the plants reduce the wall’s HP to 21. The table takes 1/10 of this roll, or 1 HP of damage.

The plants do not change when the spell ends; they remain indefinitely in their new form. To return the vegetation to its previous state, use Reverse Plant Growth (GURPS Magic: Plant Spells, p. 17)."

The size of the affected area expands quickly, spreading up the limbs and across the torso. When it reaches his neck, the victim begins to suffocate.

At each moment the caster pays the maintenance cost, the moss spreads to the following body parts, in this order:

• Lower arms and lower legs. All DX rolls are -2.
• Upper arms and upper legs. Reduce Move by 3.
• Torso. Worsen the DX roll penalty to -4 (as if grappled).
• Neck/throat. Victim begins choking (GURPS Basic Set, p. 428).
• Head. Blind, no sense of smell, cannot speak. Hearing rolls are -5.

As long as the spell is active, the subject suffers. A new “location” is covered every five seconds – even if, at that moment, all of the moss has been removed. If the body is fully covered, a new layer grows, in sequence. When the spell ends, the moss does not disappear; if it isn’t removed, it falls off the skin after one hour.

The subject, and his friends, may attempt to scrape the moss off. Two Ready maneuvers are sufficient to remove moss from the first “location” (both hands and both feet). Use the same requirement to clear the rest of the body, with two Ready maneuvers per location in the list above. The GM may reduce the time required to clear a location by one or even two Ready maneuvers if a suitable tool (knife, shovel, etc.) can be found; skill or DX checks should be required to avoid inflicting 1 HP damage on the victim accidentally. Note that the two Ready maneuvers assume a pair of functional, human hands. The GM may make adjustments (e.g., the scraper needs four Ready maneuvers if he’s using one hand).

While scraping, the victim must make a Will roll, adjusted by Fearlessness, to avoid panic. Cowardice gives its usual penalty based on the self-control number. The GM should consider Fright Checks for witnesses."

description="Crops in the area of effect harvest themselves: wheat shears just above the base, potatoes rise from the ground, apples detach from branches, etc. They drift in the air and pile themselves neatly at the center of the area. Before casting, the mage may pick another landing spot within the area, if desired. If the area contains a mixture of crops, pick one of the following: all crops growing out of the ground (wheat, corn); all crops under the ground (potatoes, peanuts); all crops hanging from vines and/or branches (apples, grapes). Failure leaves the crops right where they are. A critical failure ruins – but does not destroy – the crop and drains 1d+4 FP from the caster. If someone has sanctified the entire area with Bless Plants, treat a critical failure as an ordinary failure.

To harvest an acre – roughly the size of a U.S. football field without end zones – the spellcaster needs 10 energy and 13 minutes. That’s a small cost for an entire acre, but large farms require far more time and energy. Multiple castings increase the chances of critical failure, so the best way to magically harvest multiple acres is to pump an enormous amount of energy into a single use of the spell."

description="This spell animates all leaves (or flower petals, moss beards, etc.) in its area of effect such that any sentient creature that sees them must resist with IQ or become hypnotized. Those who lose are motionless and unaware of the passage of time; even Danger Sense is at -5. The condition ends if the subject’s sight of the leaves is blocked (even for a second), the leaves are destroyed, or he’s attacked. It stops for everyone when the spell ends, of course. Successful resistance gives the subject immunity to the spell’s effects for 30 seconds. After that, if he’s still in the area and can see the leaves, he must make a new resistance roll.

The GM can penalize any resistance roll if the leaves are unusually plentiful (-1), very colorful (-2), or falling (-3). These three penalties are not cumulative. Add -3 for anyone with Peripheral Vision that’s at least two yards inside the area. Use darkness penalties as a bonus to the roll – in dim light, the leaves are difficult to see, so they’re less likely to hypnotize. (The bonus is ignored if the subject has traits that allow him to see in the dark!) When using the Density of Vegetation rules (GURPS Magic: Plant Spells, p. 6), alter the roll by +2 if the subject is in a Sparse hex when he rolls. Adjust by -4 if the hex is Dense or Impenetrable.

The magic does not affect anyone who is outside the area looking into it. Witnesses might see a number of victims standing around in the thicket or garden, staring at the pretty leaves (GM’s decision if any current victims are in view). If the witness is a plant mage, he can roll IQ+5 to correctly guess what’s going on."

Once lit, it burns three times longer than it normally would (like Essential Wood) and emits no noise or smoke! If anyone but the caster tries to set it on fire – or the caster exposes it to flame accidentally – treat the wood as it was before the spell was cast. If it catches fire in this way, the spell ends. Improved firewood is very useful in enclosed settings such as tombs and deep caves.

The wood remains under the effect of the spell until it becomes ash (if it was lit properly). It can be detected as magical, and Dispel Magic ends the effects at any time."

The barrier has no supernatural qualities; it functions like any other fence, marking a boundary or corralling cattle.

The mage can create a similar barrier using Plant Growth and Shape Plant, but it will look unnatural, with a shape that suggests supernatural power was used to create it. The fence, meanwhile, shows no signs of supernatural creation and will not provoke suspicion among ordinary people."

A fusion of living plants can continue to grow. This spell complements Shape Plant. Both render wood and vegetation in the caster’s grip into a soft, claylike material.

A few of the tricks that can be performed with this spell: Reattach picked fruit, connect a dozen wide leaves into a blanket, or build a knobby pole by fusing thick branches end-to-end.

The mass cannot change more than ±20%. If the plant is not wooden, the object isn’t; that is, you can’t create a club from leaves. A gadgeteer or someone with Gizmos can expand the range of objects to include, for example, a flute, a bow (without the string), a bucket, or a hemp rope.

If the spell fails or is resisted, repeated attempts are at a cumulative -3 until one hour has passed. A critical failure destroys the raw material and inflicts 1d+1 FP to the caster. A critical success grants twice the natural HP to the object."

description="Cast on a small amount of plant material, the material is transformed into a derivative chemical, as if it went to a laboratory for a split second and then returned. A handful of tea leaves, for example, can be turned into a pinch of caffeine powder. Larger quantities of material require multiple castings; a mage could turn a warehouse of tea leaves into a barrel of pure caffeine, but it would take a while! The following transformations are allowed; the GM may add more.

• An opium poppy can be turned into one dose of heroin (GURPS Basic Set, p. 441).
• Cinchona bark produces quinine (TL5). (See GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 153.)
• Wood can be transmuted into dimethyl sulfoxide (TL7). (See GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 157 and GURPS High-Tech, p. 227.)
• Strychnos toxifera vine produces curare (TL5). (See GURPS High-Tech, p. 227.)
• Castor beans become ricin (TL6). (See GURPS High-Tech, p. 227.)

A successful casting produces a number of doses equal to the spell’s margin of success, minimum of one. One dose is enough for a single, normal-sized person. If the plant can generate more than one product, the caster chooses before the spell roll.

Knowledge of this spell at a given TL allows the caster to distill chemicals understood at that TL. Use Tech-Level Modifiers (GURPS Basic Set, p. 168) for other substances.

Example: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was discovered at TL7. A mage with Process Plant/TL5 would be at -10 to obtain this chemical from wood. A spellcaster with Process Plant/TL11, in a society where DMSO was only used up until TL9 (after which it was rendered obsolete by other chemicals) would be at -3.

The mage must be familiar with the end product and have some idea of the process, even if this is no more than 1 point in low-tech Expert Skill (Natural Philosophy). Other appropriate skills: Alchemy, Biology (Botany), Chemistry, and Pharmacy. Without this minimal amount of skill, a critical success on the spell roll (the equivalent of a magical miracle) is required to produce the drug."

The grass inflicts 1d-3 cutting damage every second of movement through it (minimum 0). In Dense vegetation (GURPS Magic: Plant Spells, p. 6), the damage is 1d-1, minimum of 1 per second. The damage may continue if using the optional rules for bleeding (GURPS Basic Set, p. 420). Those with DR who pass through the area might not notice the grass has been altered! Anyone who stands still in the area is unharmed by the grass. After the first point of injury, a surprised victim must make a Will roll to avoid crying out in shock and pain.

The areas of the body that can be injured depend on the height of the grass. Thus, if it’s up to the knees, victims take damage to their legs and feet. Up to the armpits, victims take damage everywhere below the neck – discounting the arms if raised. Roll hit location randomly, rerolling any invalid results.

Deal with this using the rules for jumping during combat (GURPS Basic Set, p. 352). The runner makes contact at the summit of each tented peak, and that’s when he could take damage if the trees can inflict injury by touch. Fire affects him with heat and smoke.

He cannot move slower than paced running (GURPS Basic Set, p. 354). Slower movement cancels the spell!

The ultimate length of the roots is limited only by the duration of the spell and the density of the earth (they cannot pass through solid stone). The margin of success indicates the amount of accurate detail the GM will divulge.

Example: The roots of a tree burrow through the earth, passing within 10 yards of a buried dinosaur skeleton. If the margin of success was low (1 or 2), the GM comes up with: “Something dense is within 50 feet.” If the margin was high (3 or 4), he says, “There’s a skeleton north of you, approximately 40 feet away.” A margin of 5 or more, he’ll say something like: “The skeleton of a giant sauropod – a dinosaur? a dragon? – is 41 feet away, due north.”

It may be cast as soon as a target is directly underneath the object, or it can be cast in advance and maintained until a victim is in position.

The caster must roll against Dropping or Innate Attack (Projectile) to hit, applying range penalties from him to the target (not the object) but not hit location penalties – the objects always homes in on the victim’s skull.

To see the attack coming, the target must be looking up, have Danger Sense, or make a successful Vision-2 roll; if not, he gets no defense. The attack does 1d-3 crushing damage, +2 damage per pound of the object’s weight (e.g., a 2-lb. object does 1d+1 damage). Knockdown rolls (GURPS Basic Set, p. 420) are at -5 for a normal wound (not cumulative with the -10 for a major wound)."

The GM shouldn’t tell the player the penalty! He should simply say whether the spell succeeded.

This calls for the corpses of sapient (IQ 6+) beings with grasping hands, so it’s most powerful in cemeteries and similar burial places, and rarely effective on random plots of earth (even ones full of small animal carcasses). However, the GM may agree that there’s a grave underfoot almost anywhere if the black-robe enjoys Serendipity – or if a potential victim suffers from Unluckiness or Cursed!

When the spell is cast, the arms of the dead erupt from all corpse-filled surfaces in the area and grapple everyone within a yard. In most burial grounds, those in the vicinity are grabbed by one zombie or skeleton reaching up from below. Underground, add an extra pair of arms (for a total of two undead) for victims standing within a yard of a wall or a ceiling – or two extra pairs (three undead) if both conditions hold. In an ossuary or other mass grave, double these numbers.

Each set of arms grapples with ST 10 and DX 10 (regardless of the corpses’ stats in life), but multiple pairs coordinate as a single attacker, adding ST and DX as explained in Multiple Close Combat (GURPS Basic Set, p. 392). For instance, someone standing near a wall and under a low ceiling in an underground mass grave would be grabbed by six undead with collective ST 20 and DX 20! If effective DX is above 12, the undead will reduce it to that level to make a Deceptive Attack (GURPS Basic Set, p. 369). Victims defend at -2 in any event, as the attack comes from below, above, and the sides.

As usual, grappled victims have -4 to DX (giving -2 to Block, -2 to Parry, and -1 to Dodge), and cannot move, change facing, retreat, or use Acrobatic Dodge. They may try to break free normally. If they opt to smash the undead limbs, treat each pair of arms as a single target requiring 10 HP of injury to hack apart. On a combat map, it speeds play to mark the number of intact undead in each hex and reduce this by one per set of limbs crippled.

People who avoid being grappled or who break free may move normally – but if they stay in the area, the limbs will try to grab them on their next turn. Defense is no longer at -2, but the arms will still try a Deceptive Attack if possible!"

Shamans and holy folk aren’t immune, but may add Power Investiture to their resistance roll.

A subject who fails to resist collapses in a coma. This works much as described on GURPS Basic Set, p. 429, but the victim gets no HT roll to awaken and cannot be roused with the Awaken spell or similar measures – he’s soulless, not asleep. He must roll vs. HT every 12 hours until he finally fails and dies.

Soul Prison has one creepy drawback: Victims killed by it get to roll a Quick Contest of Will with the caster at the moment of death. Slain wizards add Magery to Will, while holy folk add Power Investiture. Victory lets them return to haunt their killer as whatever kind of ghostly undead suits their personality (GM’s preference)."

Everyone past the target along that line is also attacked, at the lower of the roll the wizard would need to hit him or 9. Damage to anyone hit this way is at -1 per die. The bolt stops cold if it strikes anything that has SM +2 or more and non-metallic DR equal to or greater than maximum damage.

Example: A yellow-robe with an Innate Attack (Projectile) skill of 15 hurls a Stroke of Lightning at an orc 10 yards away. He has -4 to hit, so he rolls at 11 or less. The target is in a tight file, with allies behind him at 11, 12, 13, and 14 yards. As 11-15 yards gives -5 to hit, for 10 or less, the bolt attacks each of these foes at 9 or less (the maximum). An orc chief 50 yards down that line (-8 to hit) would be attacked at 7 or less.

Being hit by the bolt surrounds the target in a fizzing nimbus that sheds sparks and stands hair on end, which is distracting. Someone in the midst of a Concentrate maneuver must make a Will-3 roll to maintain concentration. If he’s enlarging a Missile spell, he must roll against Will to avoid dropping it. And if he’s taking an Aim, he must roll vs. Will or lose his aim.

There’s no other effect on most targets. If a spellcaster is hit, though, he briefly gains half the energy points in the bolt. He can spend these on a spell he’s currently casting, a Missile spell he’s enlarging, or a spell he starts casting on the first turn after he’s struck. A longer wait means the energy dissipates. Any energy beyond what his magic requires is likewise lost.

The bolt’s creator has no control over the energy after hurling it. If it strikes an enemy spellcaster – accidentally or in a failed distraction attempt – the foe can use the energy!

A spellcaster can benefit from any number of Transference Bolts that strike during his casting. One who’s concentrating for a long time, enlarging a Missile spell, etc. could be zapped repeatedly, while a “firing squad” could circumvent restrictions on ceremonial magic. However, the high odds of distraction (each bolt requires a check for this!) make this impractical."

In effect, they acquire the Pacifism (Self-Defense Only) disadvantage (GURPS Basic Set, p. 148), recover instantly from all aggressive traits (including Berserk), stop interpreting mental disadvantages in ways that demand violence, and ignore orders to engage in hostilities.

For the purposes of this spell, “offensive action” – on behalf of both the subjects and those who interact with them – constitutes not merely attacks but any use of items or abilities that could inflict FP or HP loss, affliction (stunning, sickness, unconsciousness, etc.), or inconvenience (e.g., disarming, grappling, or theft). Those under the spell’s influence are free to use active defenses, assist unaffected allies with helpful items or abilities, leave, summon aid, etc. Provided that a subject is left in peace, he’ll return the favor... but if he’s offered violence, this ends the spell on him, though not on others. To exploit this to get a friend to “snap out of it” calls for actual injury (at least 1 HP), as the magic gives the perception that any lesser hurt was a forgivable accident.

This is the green-robes’ only concession to pure mind control – and Pacify does count as such for the purpose of measures like Immunity to Mind Control. They view it as “fair play” because it doesn’t let the caster command the subjects to disarm, surrender, change sides, etc., or cause an affliction that makes them easier to kill (such as defense penalties or daze).

For good or for ill, the subject’s Perception replaces his Dexterity for the spell’s duration. This affects DX for all purposes, including DX-based skills and therefore Block and Parry based on them, along with Basic Speed and thus Dodge and Basic Move. The abrupt bout of second sight is likely to confuse someone who has never experienced this spell (that’s most non-Pentaclists, as this is a secret spell!) – make an IQ roll or be mentally stunned, with an IQ roll to recover allowed each turn.

Subjects with DX greater than or equal to Per resist using DX. Those who have DX less than Per but no past experience with this magic feel an upsetting influence similar to the Mental Stun spell (GURPS Magic, p. 135), and instinctively resist with Per (not Will). People with DX less than Per and familiarity with Mind over Matter experience only beneficial effects; don’t bother with a resistance roll.

Example: A thug with DX 14, Per 10 resists at 14. Failure means he functions at DX 10, suffering -4 to DX and DX-based skills, -2 to Block and Parry, and -1.00 to Basic Speed. Moreover, if he has never experienced the spell, he must make an IQ roll to avoid mental stun. A rogue with DX 12, Per 16 and would stand to function at DX 16, gaining +4 to DX and DX-based skills, +2 to Block and Parry, and +1.00 to Basic Speed. However, if he’s unfamiliar with the effect, he resists reflexively at 16, and failure also forces a check for mental stun.

This is potentially far cheaper and more powerful than the Grace spell (GURPS Magic, p. 37) on high-Per, low-DX subjects, but a poor substitute for the Clumsiness spell (GURPS Magic, p. 36) on high-DX targets. Thus, it’s rarely used offensively."

For each subject, also make a single reaction roll toward the nearest individual, using all the usual modifiers. If several people are equally proximate, choose one at random. A “Poor” reaction (result of 7-9) means that any mental disadvantage that could cause horrible behavior toward that person does – Greed, Lecherousness, or Bloodlust might lead to attempted theft, rape, or murder, respectively. A “Bad” or worse reaction (6 or less) means the subject initiates combat instead!

If Discord is cast in combat, where hostility runs rampant, subjects will pursue the opposition as though afflicted with Intolerance, even if ordered not to do so or one of their allies needs help. Thus, the spell might succeed only in driving every last enemy warrior to single out one of the caster’s friends!

description="Summons something far beyond mere animals, spirits, or even demons – most often a manifestation of an archdevil or god. Forget about control! When the spell is cast, make a reaction roll, ignoring all modifiers except that for whatever the GM decides this specific entity wants right now, which can be up to +5 for something dangerous or +10 for near-impossible stuff like sacrificing the sitting head of state to the Demon Lord of Strife. It’s up to the GM whether the caster(s) know what this need is.

On a “Good” or worse reaction (15 or less), the being destroys the caster(s) outright in whatever way suits its nature: demon lords rip out souls, fire gods produce hundreds of dice of Essential Fire, creator gods unmake. The same happens on any critical failure.

A result of “Very Good” (16-18) means the entity appears briefly and departs without doing harm – though it might mention what it really wants for next time.

A roll of “Excellent” (19+) results in the being granting one wish on a par with Great Wish (GURPS Magic, p. 62), which must be in keeping with that entity’s role and disposition.

This spell is relatively easy to learn and quick to cast (50 minutes using ceremonial magic), but profoundly draining – usually requiring the whole cult and several external energy sources – and incredibly risky."

At the end of that time, the caster spends the energy and casts the spell. On a success, the subject must answer, “Do I accept this investiture?” The spell binds them only if they respond “Yes.” There’s no way to bind someone unwilling – but also no requirement to reveal the full truth about the spell!

A non-mage bound by Invest gains Magery 1 (Radically Unstable Magery, -50%) [8] for free. Someone with Magery replaces it with however many levels of limited Magery its cost would buy, rounding down; e.g., Magery 2 [25] becomes Magery 4 (Radically Unstable Magery, -50%) [23]. The caster gains nothing right away... but each time their subject suffers a magical backfire (which is likely), a roll of 3 or 18 on the Critical Spell Failure Table grants the “master” one free character point in addition to its other effects! Distance has no effect on this.

The subject can buy Radically Unstable Magery down to -10% with earned points, but cannot remove the limitation completely. Even Remove Curse can do nothing. But if they learn Invest, they can use points it earns them to eliminate the limitation.

Invest doesn’t count as a spell “on” for the caster, but they can have only one “asset” per two full Magery levels (typically three subjects, since the spell requires Magery 6). As only around 1% of a subject’s critical failures grant a point, there’s an incentive to go for the maximum and encourage those people to use poorly understood magic regularly."

Order from Chaos is cast at -1 per yard to the unfortunate wizard. The subject is not that person, however, but their catastrophe. Thus, their abilities and defensive spells have no effect on the casting.

Any success recovers energy points equal to margin of success, to a maximum of the cost of the other wizard’s spell, not reduced for their high skill. It’s irrelevant where the energy originally came from: FP, HP, Energy Reserve, external power source, etc. The harvested energy is available for the caster’s next spell, which they must begin at once (on their next turn in combat, within one second otherwise); Order from Chaos counts as a spell “on” during its casting. Energy in excess of that needed is lost.

Ordinary failure recovers no energy and costs 1 FP. Critical failure means the other wizard’s backfire somehow worsens to include the caster: injury affects them both (and anybody between them!), harmful spells that go astray are drawn to the caster of Order from Chaos, detectable effects reveal that person’s presence, demons are hostile to both parties, and so on.

description="Creates a temporary “spirit realm” outside reality in which dreamers can meet and interact. When the spell is successfully cast, the caster falls asleep for its duration. They define the appearance of the “dream bubble,” which may be anything they can reasonably imagine; many opt for a familiar building or natural landscape, while some Dream Magicians with hostile or weird intentions create terrifying hellscapes. Creating a detailed, convincing environment that is not based on a place the caster knows well may require an Artist (Illusion) skill roll, at the GM’s option.

Having created the “bubble,” the caster may draw or invite others into it. Other magicians who are aware that the bubble has been created can enter it by casting Dream Sending or Dream Projection with the creator as the subject (the caster need not resist if they want the visitor to enter), or by casting Ethereal Body and traveling to the creator’s physical location. In the latter case, the creator may refuse the visitor admission by winning a Quick Contest of Will. Otherwise, the creator may draw others in by casting Dream Projection on them; if they wish to accept the invitation, they need not resist that spell. Create Dream Bubble does not count as a spell “on” for its caster when casting Dream Sending or Dream Projection. Visitors may also use other magical effects or psionic powers analogous to the spells mentioned.

The creator and any visitors not using Ethereal Body appear to be sleeping normally in the real world. Close examination will suggest that they are experiencing vivid dreams. Shaking, loud noises (e.g., shouting in their ears), or physical injury wake them and bring them out of the bubble mentally stunned (Will roll to recover), though the creator can prevent this with a Will roll; in that case, a repeated attempt is possible after five minutes.

Visitors who have entered the bubble by casting spells of their own may leave at any time but must recast their spell to return; those drawn in by the creator’s use of Dream Projection must win a Quick Contest of their Will-3 against the creator’s unmodified Will to leave without permission. The creator can expel anyone else from the bubble by winning a Quick Contest of Will, which they may try once per minute. Anyone casting Dream Viewing successfully on the creator or anyone else within the bubble can observe what is going on within, though the view is slightly hazy and distorted. Other mind-reading spells or powers pick up hints and glimpses.

Within the bubble, the creator has near-total control of “reality”: They can “teleport” anywhere inside it in one turn, or observe any point within it (with sight, hearing, and smell) by concentrating. They can change the details of the situation – creating, deleting, transforming, or repairing inanimate objects up to human size, moving them around, changing lighting levels, and so on – by concentrating for a turn and making an IQ or Artist (Illusion) skill roll. They can likewise create animated objects (including seemingly living creatures) with ST and DX up to their skill with the spell, but these remain capable of independent movement only while the creator concentrates on them.

The creator can thus inflict horrifying sights and sounds on their “guests,” triggering Fright Checks by coming up with something suitably unpleasant; the GM decides on modifiers, especially if a Phobia is involved, but anyone who knows and understands what is going on gets +3 to the check. Other characters within the bubble are limited to their normal abilities, including use of any nonmagical equipment they had on their persons when drawn in; they can use magic, psionic powers, and suchlike, but the creator can dispel such effects with a thought.

Elements of the landscape can affect the sense of touch, and can therefore inflict pain and seemingly damage, as can individuals who come into physical conflict. However, no one can be reduced below 0 HP in a dream bubble, and those who go unconscious or “die” within the bubble instantly disappear and reawaken in the real world. Physical injuries suffered in the bubble mostly disappear on awakening, unless the victim fails a Will+3 roll, in which case they retain 10% of the injury suffered in the form of weird livid scars; if they were horribly injured in the bubble, a Fright Check may be appropriate. No effects of drugs, poisons, acid, etc. carry over to reality. Mind-control and similar spells cast by the bubble’s creator do persist in the real world, however.

When the spell ends or people otherwise leave the bubble, they return to their normal bodies as if waking from sleep. However, time spent in the bubble doesn’t fulfill sleep requirements or count as rest for the purpose of FP recovery. Visitors can remember events in the bubble clearly, though they may think of them as a vivid dream."

The first step is to cast Dream Projection on the intended target, or to cast Create Dream Bubble and draw that person into the bubble; neither of those spells counts as a spell “on” when casting this one. Next, cast Incepted Dominance. Within a dream bubble, the subject resists at -4 – but the caster should avoid having anyone else in the bubble who doesn’t support their intentions, as such people may interfere, giving the victim from +1 to +5 to resist, depending on the scale and appropriateness of their interventions. While the actual casting time is relatively short, the caster must then spend some time working to accomplish the desired effects.

The potential effects are subtle but powerful, because the caster gets deep inside the subject’s mind. The process involves a lot of manipulation of images and perceptions – it’s most fun if the GM and players come up with descriptions of what appears to happen. The caster can cause the subject to forget facts, skills, or spells as with Permanent Forgetfulness (GURPS Magic, p. 138), plant false memories as with False Memory (GURPS Magic, p. 139), inflict the equivalent of a Great Geas (GURPS Magic, p. 141), or add a mental disadvantage worth from -1 to -5 points. Up to six such changes are possible, though these can include only one Great Geas equivalent and one mental disadvantage, and each requires one hour of work; thus, creating six effects can take most of a night’s sleep.

These changes are extremely difficult to reverse. Dispel Magic is ineffective. Remove Curse works, but Incepted Dominance resists at +5. Another casting of this spell can serve the purpose, and is at +2 if its sole objective is to undo one or more effects of a previous casting."

Speaking the word generates a magical effect, which means that potential victims do not have to be able to hear the caster or understand their language – though of course that helps to direct them. They resist the spell with the lower of HT or Will, at a basic -5, but also at +1 per full 5 yards of distance from the caster (so, individuals 70-74 yards away resist at the worse of HT+9 or Will+9). 

The effects on anyone who fails to resist are equivalent to a Charm spell (GURPS Magic, p. 139), but last until the subject shakes them off. Each victim can start trying to shake off the effect after 2d minutes; this requires a Will-2 roll, or Will-5 if the original casting was a critical success, and can be attempted every 10 seconds.

Anyone who resists the initial casting is fully aware of what was just attempted. Naturally, many people take this very badly! If the spell critically fails, everyone who could have been affected knows that the caster tried to do something to them."

Moving inanimate objects within or entering that area travel 1 yard further and then stop completely. If they were flying, they fall to the ground – though they may glide down or make a controlled fall, if that is within their normal capabilities – but because their falling rate is also affected, they hit the ground (or move downward out of the area) at a speed of only 1 yard/second. Missiles subject to this effect cannot move fast enough to do significant damage, while lightning bolts entering the zone are reduced to harmless sparks. The loudest noises are damped to the level of a quiet conversational voice, existing fires continue to burn but do only 1/4 damage, and any winds are reduced to light breezes (2 on the Beaufort scale; see GURPS Magic, p. 194) unless they were caused by a magic spell or similar (which continues to work if it successfully resists this spell).

Living things within the area must successfully resist the spell with Will (plus any Magic Resistance) to do anything but stand still and speak in a whisper, and even if they resist, they can only move 1 yard and speak in a normal voice, not attack or defend. They must attempt resistance on every turn on which they wish to act. The spell also stills emotions; most beings caught within the zone become calm, and anyone taking actions caused by a mental disadvantage must immediately make a new self-control roll at +5, whether they want to or not.

Magic-workers are limited to normal speech within the area; spells that require gestures or shouted words cannot be cast. Psionic powers work fine there but cannot move objects at faster than 1 yard/second, while any energy damage they do is halved. Attacks based on high-intensity light or similar can enter from outside but also do half damage.

For the purposes of this spell, all movement rates are relative to the nearest solid ground. If it were somehow cast in outer space, they would be measured relative to the caster.

Word of Stillness can also be cast at -2 as a Blocking spell, to defend the caster or someone within 3 yards against melee attacks, thrown weapons, arrows, crossbow bolts, sling projectiles, and Missile spells; it can also be used against lightning bolts and other beam attacks, but even if it works, these still hit for half damage. When successfully cast for this purpose, the spell has its other usual effects. If it stops a ranged attack, the missile or spell falls to the ground at a random point between the edge of the area of effect (or the attacker, if they are within the area) and the target; explosive and similar attacks detonate at the point where they fall."

description="This Divination spell (GURPS Magic, pp. 108-109) involves the caster contacting a minor angelic being and questioning it. The entity involved is specifically assigned by higher powers to grant knowledge to mortals, so the spell isn’t quite as dangerous as it sounds – though anyone casting it when not in a state of ritual purity is usually in serious trouble, as the angel will notice. Its answers are not limited to “yes” or “no,” and can run to three or four sentences; it can also create simple visions to illustrate its verbal responses. Because this being effectively knows whatever it needs to know to answer the questions posed, the spell takes no long-distance modifiers and no time modifiers for events in the past; events in the future do impose time modifiers (GURPS Magic, p. 81), however, because angels must respect free will and divine ineffability.

The angel can in principle provide information about almost anything, but it is prohibited from telling mortals too much about the higher mysteries of the universe; the GM decides what this implies. Equally, its purpose is to answer significant questions about subjects such as the nations of the world, conditions in distant lands, and the laws of nature – questioning it about local events, individuals (other than rulers and anyone else whose actions influence whole nations), lost items, etc. is an insult to its sacred duty. When in doubt, the GM can roll a reaction for the being, with no modifiers other than one based on the question’s perceived triviality and possibly one for the caster’s current degree of ritual purity. A “Very Good” or better reaction gets a full answer, a “Good” reaction earns a brusque reply, a “Poor” reaction causes the angel to depart in anger, and any worse reaction means the spell will not work for the caster for 2d weeks.

Also at the GM’s option, all critical failures with this spell may summon a demonic being with a talent for impersonating angels and a truly diabolical sense of humor."

Theurges casting this spell when not in a state of immaculate ritual purity can still succeed but are likely to receive an immediate visit from an angelic being.

description="Some powerful theurges, delving into texts and lore on the edge of what is morally permissible, learn this spell... which originally appeared in GURPS Magical Styles: Horror Magic as a secret spell of various dubious cults. A few theurges convince themselves that there are legitimate uses for it. Some even manage to cast it, with the assistance of allies, and survive.

It takes a Magus to make it work within the theurgic paradigm, but many theurges deny that it should be classed as a theurgic spell at all. The spell is relatively easy to learn and quick to cast (50 minutes using ceremonial magic), but profoundly draining – usually requiring dozens of assistants (good luck finding volunteers) and several external energy sources – and incredibly risky.

It summons something far beyond mere animals, spirits, or even demons – most often a manifestation of an archangel or “god” (which the theurge regards as an “emanation” of the One God). Forget about control! When the spell is cast, make a reaction roll, ignoring all modifiers except that for whatever the GM decides this specific entity wants right now, which can be up to +5 for something dangerous or +10 for near-impossible stuff like obliterating the evil cult that secretly rules an empire. It’s up to the GM whether the caster(s) know what this need is; smart casters may use Divination (Angelic Communion) to find out beforehand.

On a “Good” or worse reaction (15 or less), the being destroys the caster(s) outright in whatever way suits its nature: death angels rip out souls, lords of elemental fire produce hundreds of dice of Essential Fire, avatars of creator gods unmake. The same happens on any critical failure.

A result of “Very Good” (16-18) means the entity appears briefly and departs without doing harm – though it might mention what it really wants for next time.

A roll of “Excellent” (19+) results in the being granting one wish on a par with Great Wish (GURPS Magic, p. 62), which must be in keeping with that entity’s role and disposition."

Treat this as a cheap, highly addictive, and legal psychological Addiction (-5 points), which they can buy off with bonus character points."

item="—"
description="Creates doses of a poison specially adapted to the caster’s current needs. For details on the rules terminology used here, see GURPS Basic Set, pp. 437-439.

Base energy cost to create one dose of either a blood agent suitable for applying to an edged weapon as a follow-up poison or a digestive agent is 4. For one that functions as both a blood agent and a digestive agent, add +2 to cost per dose. For a contact agent suitable for smearing on a blunt weapon or a surface the victim will touch (and that will also serve as a blood and digestive agent), add +3 to cost per dose. The poison is created at touch range from the caster, in any small container, on a weapon or surface, or in food.

The poison remains potent for one week after being created, and has a subtle, unique, mildly unpleasant flavor or odor. A Taste, Smell, or Per-based Poisons roll, all at -2, can detect this by chance – but the -2 becomes +1 for anyone explicitly checking for poison. Test Food, and appropriate alchemical and medical skills, can also detect the poison; the Alchemy, Physician, or Poisons skill identifies it as “a rare magical toxin” (simply “a rare toxin,” for someone who’s unaware of magic). All detection rolls are at the usual +2 per doubling of dosage. Anyone who knows this spell gets +2 to all such rolls, and will know exactly what the poison is if they succeed.

A victim exposed to this poison must roll against HT. On a success, they take 2 HP injury. Failure means they suffer 1d+2 HP and have -4 to all skills and spells until these HP are restored. Symptoms are stomach cramps for a digestive agent, or muscle spasms for a blood or contact agent.

The spell allows considerable variation of the above assumptions. The poison may be given any delay between 10 seconds and one day without changing energy cost. Poison with a delay can further be made cyclic, with an interval equal to the delay; add 50% to casting cost (round up) per extra cycle of injury. If the poison is detected and identified, it can be treated during the delay or the cyclic period with a Physician roll at -2; success prevents any further injury.

The poison can also be made more potent, with every -1 to HT rolls to resist it and to Physician rolls to treat it, or +1 to injury suffered caused on a failed HT roll, adding +2 to final cost per dose. It can be made subtler, with every -1 to all rolls to detect it adding +2 to final cost per dose. Finally, it can be made magic resistant, with every -1 on all rolls to cast Resist Poison or Neutralize Poison on the victim adding +1 to final cost per dose."

The GM should estimate the value for each item as if it were assessed by the nearest appropriate merchant for this type of item. For example, the value of a rare Indian carpet is the average price that would be given by a fabric merchant who understood its worth.

description="This enchantment fuses together two or more very early embryos (no more than week-old if human) of different species into a single organism. The subject may be a live host or a growth tank (GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 20). If the subject was already pregnant with an early embryo, the other embryos must be implanted as part of the process using surgical means or a Transfer Pregnancy spell (GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 32). Otherwise, at least two embryos must be implanted via these means, and if using a live host, at least one of the embryos must also be the host’s species. The resulting chimera will blend all species’ traits, with appropriate advantages and disadvantages (see Chimerization, GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 38); the details are up to the GM. 

Modifiers to skill roll: 0 if very close cross (e.g., wolf-dog), -3 if closely related (e.g., ape-human, sheep-goat or tiger-lion), -6 for distant hybrids (e.g., fox-human or alligator-viper), -8 for radical hybrids (e.g., crocodile-bat or human-hummingbird). Add +4 if trying to duplicate a previous success using the same mix, -4 if mixing three species, -8 if mixing four, -12 if mixing five, etc.

Success means a viable chimera forms but (especially if the caster got very ambitious) it will not be perfect: the GM should give it several unplanned disadvantages. Critical success means an excellent mix of advantageous traits and mild disadvantages. 

Failure means the spell fails to work, terminating any natural pregnancy in the process. Optionally, failure by 1 means the implanted embryos fail to fuse, but do not die unless the host could not reasonably sustain them; otherwise it’s a multiple pregnancy (e.g., an attempt at an elf-dwarf fusion results in elf and dwarf fraternal twins).

On a critical failure, the creator gets something that appears to be viable enough to carry to term, but which proves to be either horribly deformed, life-threatening to the mother (if using a live host), or both.

If the spell works, it also ensures the embryo will be carried safely to term. The size of the fetus will usually be appropriate to the host mother, e.g., a whale-human carried by a human mother (or appropriately-sized growth tank) might be larger than her normal baby, but not by much. It is also possible to remove a developing chimera and implant it somewhere else – see Surrogate Motherhood (GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 20) and Growth Tanks (GURPS Bio-Tech, p. 20)."

Ley Tap is cast at a penalty equal to distance from the ley line in yards, like any Regular spell. If it succeeds, the margin of success is the additional distance in yards the caster can move from the ley line without cutting off the flow of mana.

Using energy from a megaline is hazardous; treat any spell cast with such energy as if it had been cast in a very high mana area – that is, any failure counts as a critical failure, and a rolled critical failure produces a memorable disaster.

description="Similar to Awaken Craft Spirit or Awaken Computer, this spell grants a building awareness and sapience. It can perceive structural stresses and compensate for them, giving it +2 to HT. In addition, it can open or shut doors or windows, make creaking noises with its floorboards, and, at higher TLs, turn faucets or switches on and off. Including bells, organ pipes, or other sound generators during construction can give a structure more ways to communicate.

If the house is at high enough TL to be run by a computer, this spell does not awaken the computer; use Awaken Computer for that. However, if the computer is sapient, it will react as if its body was being possessed by an alien entity – which is exactly what has happened.

An awakened building can help secure itself against intruders, using its control of the structure to perform hostile actions. A building spirit that isn’t treated with respect by the legitimate occupants may start treating them as intruders. A critical failure on the original casting produces a building spirit that hates everyone! Nearly all building spirits will want to protect and improve their buildings, no matter how they feel about the inhabitants."

description="This spell creates a sunbolt that does impaling damage to whatever it hits, remains in quasi-solid form (but cannot be removed – it will simply flow like quicksilver if anyone makes an attempt to grab or teleport it), and then explodes after a three-second delay. During the delay, whatever has been hit – or, if is destroyed outright by the bolt, the area where it was located – will glow with a yellow-white light, which will ominously increase in brilliance and intensity until the explosion takes place. The explosion itself is similar to a blast from an Explosive Fireball (in other words, divide damage by 3 times the distance to the center of the blast, rounding any fractions down). As with Sunbolt, Sunburst has 1/2D 75, Max 150, and Acc 2. A struck target takes full damage from the bolt and the explosion. If the bolt misses its target, the explosion can still injure people; in such situations, use the rules for Attacking an Area and Explosions (GURPS Basic Set, pp. 414-415) to determine what actually gets hit.

What makes the Sunburst particularly dangerous is that there is no limit to the amount of energy a caster may put into the spell. A sufficiently large powerstone (or a suicide casting where a mage burns through FP and HP) can produce effects similar to modern artillery pieces.

Like anything creating an explosion, a Sunburst has an incendiary effect and possesses the potential to set things on fire. Aiming one at combustible targets such as straw, logs, lamp oil, or people who have been covered with tar is a good way to maximize its effect."

description="This spell is inspired by claims and accounts from modern real-world occultists. It creates an immaterial energy reserve of potentially indefinite size. It’s considered a Meta-Spell.

Raise Cone of Power can only be cast ceremonially (GURPS Basic Set, p. 238). The amount of energy generated depends on the local mana level. For every hour of ritual, each participant – regardless of whether he knows the spell – raises 1 point in low mana, 2 points in normal mana, or 4 points in high mana. The initial casting takes one hour and raises an hour’s worth of energy. Maintaining the spell requires uninterrupted ceremonial activity, but continues to increase the energy accumulated every hour. At the GM’s option, energetic dancing (requires a successful Dancing roll; costs FP as for Hiking, GURPS Basic Set, p. 426) doubles the energy that a participant can produce in an hour – and a critical success might triple it!

After the first hour, anyone involved in the casting can drop out of the ceremony (so long as one person who knows the spell remains involved), and take a Concentrate maneuver and make an IQ roll to draw on the Cone to power another spell, which must be cast starting on the next turn. Failure on this spell draws no energy from the Cone; critical failure drains the spell’s full casting cost. The Cone cannot be tapped to power itself. This can continue – for any number of spells – until the Cone is exhausted or the ceremony ends."

timetocast="10 seconds per cubic foot of anvil."
prereq="Magery 3, Rain of Shards, and Teleport."
item="Staff or wand. Usable only by mages. Energy cost to create: 5,000. Extremely rare!."
description="A relatively silly spell developed by a mage millennia ago solely for the purpose of making a point, this spell is best cast outside, but can be performed inside if the caster does not care about collateral damage. Unlike most missile spells, the spell is not held by the caster and then thrown. Instead, an iron anvil falls from the sky with enough force that it will pass through roofs, floors, and ceilings until it hits the ground. (This spell also may be granted by various gods, particularly gods of the forge, who appreciate the irony of it.)

The anvil itself is produced through a refined application of Create Metal and Shape Metal. The spell creates one cubic foot of iron, 100 yards in the air. When it falls, it lands on a one-hex area. The spell can be “held,” increasing the radius of the area covered by one hex for each second the spell is cast. Calculate falling damage for the proper weight (see GURPS Basic Set, p. 430); one cubic foot of iron weighs 500 lbs., which does 28d crushing damage. Aerodynamic shapes, atmospheric densities greater than standard, and differing gravities may cause the damage to change. 

When cast the mage must make a roll against Artillery (Bombs) to hit the target. On a critical failure, the mage hits himself! Note that the “anvil” does not have to take the shape of an anvil; the mage creates the shape of the “anvil” at casting time. Common forms are round balls, rectangular and pyramidal prisms, and, of course, the obligatory anvil shape.

Because it is a “missile” spell, Reverse Missiles (GURPS Magic, p. 168) will protect the target; however, this merely returns the anvil to its starting location! The target is still at risk of being hit a second time once gravity reasserts itself on the anvil."
