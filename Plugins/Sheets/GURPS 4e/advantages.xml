        desc="You have an attack that causes a baneful, nondamaging effect: blindness, paralysis, weakness, etc. This might be an ultra-tech beam weapon, a chemical spray, a supernatural gaze attack, or almost anything else. Specify the details when you buy the advantage. 

By default, Affliction is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). 

If you hit, your victim gets a HT+1 roll to resist. Apply a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (so Affliction 1 gives an unmodified HT roll). The victim gets a bonus equal to his DR unless the Affliction has one of the following modifiers: Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Cosmic, Follow-Up, Malediction, Respiratory Agent or Sense-Based. To reduce the effects of DR, add the Armor Divisor enhancement. The victim gets a further +3 if he is beyond 1/2D range. 

If the victim makes his HT roll, he is unaffected. If he fails, he suffers the effects of the Affliction. By default, he is stunned (see p. 420). He may roll vs. HT+1 once per second to recover, but once again at a penalty equal to the level of the Affliction (DR has no effect on this roll). 

If your Affliction causes an effect other than stunning, this is a special enhancement (see below). You can inflict more than one effect by giving your Affliction multiple special enhancements. These effects occur simultaneously, except where noted. 

Successive Afflictions that produce the same effects are not normally cumulative. Use the single worst effect. 

Use the special enhancements below to create specific Afflictions. Many Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102) are also logical. For instance, a blinding flash is Sense-Based (p. 109); most drugs have Follow-Up (p. 105), Blood Agent (p. 102), or Contact Agent (p. 103); supernatural attacks like the “evil eye” use Malediction (p. 106); and touch attacks call for Melee Attack (p. 112). 

If an Affliction produces two or more effects due to the special enhancements below, some of these effects may be secondary. Secondary effects occur only if the victim fails his HT roll by 5 or more or rolls a critical failure. A secondary effect is worth 1/5 as much; e.g., Secondary Heart Attack is +60% rather than +300%. 

Once you have chosen all the modifiers on your Affliction, describe the nature of the attack as detailed for Innate Attack (p. 61)."
        Sp_lim="—"
        Sp_enh="Advantage: The victim immediately experiences the effects of a specific physical or mental advantage. Advantages with instantaneous effects affect the target once, as soon as he is hit, if he fails his HT roll; e.g., Warp immediately teleports the subject. Advantages that can be switched on and off (such as Insubstantiality) are automatically “on” for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll, and are not under the subject’s control. This is worth +10% per point the advantage is worth; e.g., Insubstantiality would be +800%! If the advantage comes in levels, specify the level. 

Attribute Penalty: The victim suffers temporary attribute loss. This is +5% per -1 to ST or HT, or +10% per -1 to DX or IQ. For instance, an attack that caused DX-3 and IQ-2 would be +50%. Lower all skills based on reduced attributes by a like amount. ST penalties also reduce BL and damage, while IQ reductions also apply to Will and Perception. Secondary characteristics are not otherwise affected; for instance, HT reduction does not affect Basic Speed or FP. Penalties last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll. 

Cancellation: You can cancel the effects of your Affliction before the duration would expire. This requires either a touch or a second, successful activation roll with whatever range penalties (to the subject) would normally apply. +10%.

Coma: The victim collapses, profoundly unconscious, and will likely die in days unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +250%. 

Cumulative: Repeated attacks are cumulative! You must take this in conjunction with Attribute Penalty, or with an Advantage, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage Enhancement that inflicts a “leveled” trait. +400%. 

Disadvantage: The victim temporarily gains one or more specific physical or mental disadvantages (but not self-imposed mental disadvantages – see p. 121). This is worth +1% per point the temporary disadvantages are worth; e.g., Paranoia [-10] is worth +10%. If a disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level. The disadvantages last for one minute per point by which the victim fails his HT roll. 

Heart Attack: The victim suffers an incapacitating heart attack, and will die in minutes unless treated; see Mortal Conditions (p. 429). +300%. 

Incapacitation: The victim is incapacitated for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. After that, he is stunned until he can make a HT roll (roll once per second). If you combine Incapacitation with other effects (such as Irritant), those effects occur after the Incapacitation wears off; they replace the stunning and last for the same length of time the Incapacitation did. Incapacitation can take the form of any of the following: Daze, +50%; Hallucinating, +50%; Retching, +50%; Agony, +100%; Choking, +100%; Ecstasy, +100%; Seizure, +100%; Paralysis, +150%; Sleep, +150%; or Unconsciousness, +200%. See Incapacitating Conditions (p. 428) for the game effects. 

Irritant: The victim suffers an impairing but non-incapacitating condition instead of being stunned. It lasts for a number of minutes equal to the margin of failure on his HT roll. The possibilities are Tipsy +10%; Coughing, +20%; Drunk, +20%; Moderate Pain, +20%; Euphoria, +30%; Nauseated, +30%; Severe Pain, +40%; or Terrible Pain, +60%. For definitions, see Irritating Conditions (p. 428). 

Negated Advantage: The victim loses a specific advantage for one minute per point by which he failed his HT roll. There is no effect if the victim lacks that advantage! This enhancement is worth +1% per point the advantage is worth. If the advantage comes in levels, you must specify the level negated. 

Stunning: May only accompany Advantage, Attribute Penalty, Disadvantage, or Negated Advantage. If the victim fails to resist, he is stunned (per an unmodified Affliction) in addition to the effects of the other enhancement(s). +10%.

Malfunction: You can temporarily increase or decrease an item’s Malfunction value by one. If it doesn’t normally have Malf., treat it as 19. For firearms and other weapons, this has the usual results; for equipment which normally lacks Malf., any roll indicating a malfunction means it breaks down and requires a minor repair (p. B484). A roll of three or more over its Malf. (or an 18) means it requires a major repair instead! At the GM’s option, you can affect more than just personal gear; add Cosmic (+50%) to target vehicles, cybernetic implants, etc. This costs +10% per ±1 to Malf. (choose to either increase or decrease when selecting the disadvantage), or +20% per 1 point if you can do both.

Negated Disadvantage: The victim loses a specific disadvantage for one minute per point by which he fails his HT roll. If he lacks that disadvantage, there’s no effect. This is worth +10% per point the disadvantage is worth. If the disadvantage comes in levels, specify the level negated.

Temporal Stasis: The victim and his equipment stop in time. Time continues to flow in the rest of the universe, just not for him. He’s frozen in place – in mid-action or even midair. He doesn’t age, breathe, or require sustenance. Injury, disease, and poison halt their progress. He keeps his position in the local frame of reference (usually a planet), but the physical world doesn’t otherwise affect him. He can’t be injured, moved, robbed, etc. In most settings, this extends to supernatural powers (e.g., his mind is unreadable). Likewise, he’s unaware of the universe and can’t act in any way, not even mentally. This lasts for a minute per point by which he fails his HT roll. After that, his actions, perceptions, and so on pick up where they left off. This isn’t a metabolic effect; it can afflict objects (see Afflictions and Inanimate Targets, p. 40). +1,000%."

        type="Social"
        category="—"
        desc="Many fictional heroes have partners – loyal comrades, faithful sidekicks, trusted retainers, or lifelong friends – who accompany them on adventures. These partners are “Allies.” 

The other PCs in your adventuring party are, in a sense, “allies.” But they can be unreliable allies indeed. Often they are chance acquaintances, first encountered at a roadside tavern only hours ago. They have their own hidden goals, ethics, and motives, which might not coincide with your own. 

An NPC Ally, on the other hand, is wholly reliable. Perhaps you fought side by side in a long war, trained under the same master, or grew up in the same village. The two of you trust each other implicitly. You travel together, fight back-to-back, share rations in hard times, and trade watches through the night. 

Your Ally is usually agreeable to your suggestions, but he is not your puppet. He will disagree with you from time to time. An Ally may try to dissuade you from a plan that seems foolish to him – and if he can’t talk you out of the plan, he may refuse to cooperate. An Ally may even cause problems for you: picking fights, landing in jail, insulting a high noble . . . Of course, the Ally will also try to bail you out when you make mistakes. 

The GM will not award you bonus character points for any play session in which you betray, attack, or unnecessarily endanger your Ally. Blatant, prolonged, or severe betrayal will break the trust between you and your Ally, and he will leave you permanently. If you drive your Ally off in this way, the points you spent on him are gone, reducing your point value. Leading your Ally into danger is all right, as long as you face the same danger and are a responsible leader. 

The point cost for an Ally depends on his power and frequency of appearance. Only PCs who take NPCs as Allies pay points for the privilege. Two PCs can be mutual “allies” for free, as can two NPCs – and NPCs never pay points for PCs as Allies. An Ally is specifically a skilled NPC associate for one PC. 

Ally’s Power: Consult the following table to determine how many points you must spend on your Ally. “Point Total” is the Ally’s point total expressed as a percentage of the PC’s starting points; “Cost” is the cost of the Ally. If the Ally’s point total falls between two percentages, use the higher. 
Point Total: 25%, Cost: 1 point;
Point Total: 50%, Cost: 2 points;
Point Total: 75%, Cost: 3 points;
Point Total: 100%, Cost: 5 points; 
Point Total: 150%, Cost: 10 points. 

Allies built on more than 150% of the PC’s starting points are not allowed; treat such NPCs as Patrons (see p. 72). Exception: The progression above extends indefinitely for nonsentient (IQ 0) Allies; each +50% of the PC’s starting points costs a further +5 points. 

Allies built on no more than 100% of the PC’s starting points may also be Dependents (see p. 131). Add the cost of Ally and Dependent together, and treat the combination as a single trait: an advantage if the total point cost is positive, a disadvantage if it is negative. 

Ally Groups: You may purchase as many Allies as you can afford. Each Ally is normally a separate advantage, but you can treat a group of related Allies as a single trait to save space on your character sheet. 

For a group of individuals – with their own unique abilities and character sheets – add the costs of the individual Allies to find the cost of the group, adjust the total cost for frequency of appearance, and then apply any special modifiers. For a group of more than five identical and interchangeable allies that share a single character sheet – for instance, an army of low-grade thugs or a swarm of robot drones – find the point cost to have one member of the group as an Ally, and then multiply that cost as follows to find the cost of the group: 
Size of Group | Multiplier
6-10: x6; 
11-20: x8; 
21-50: x10; 
51-100: x12. 

Add x6 to the multiplier per tenfold increase in number (e.g., 100,000 Allies would be x30). The GM may require an Unusual Background (p. 96) if you wish to have hordes of Allies, or even prohibit groups larger than a certain size – although he might permit an army or other large group as a Patron. Frequency of appearance multipliers and special modifiers (if any) apply to the final cost of the entire group.

Frequency of Appearance: Choose a frequency of appearance (see p. 36). If your Ally appears at the start of an adventure, he accompanies you for the duration of that adventure. 

Allies in Play: As with Dependents (p. 131), the GM will adjust your Ally’s abilities in order to keep his point total a fixed percentage of your own as you earn points. This will keep his value as an advantage constant. The GM decides how the Ally evolves, although he might ask you for your input. 

If your Ally dies through no fault of yours, the GM will not penalize you. You may put the points spent on the deceased Ally toward a new Ally. The new relationship should normally develop gradually, but the GM might allow an NPC to become an Ally on the spot if you have done something that would win him over (e.g., saving his life). This is especially appropriate in cultures where debts of honor are taken seriously! 

There is no penalty for amicably parting ways with your Ally. You may use the points spent on him to buy a new Ally met during play. At the GM’s discretion, you may trade in any remaining points for money (see p. 26), reflecting parting gifts. 

Familiars: Wizards, telepaths, and so on are often supernaturally linked to special Allies known as familiars. These are usually animals or spirits. 

Work out a familiar’s basic abilities with the GM, starting with the racial template of an ordinary creature of its kind. If its racial IQ is 5 or less, raise it to at least 6. Consider buying off Cannot Speak, if applicable. Most familiars have supernatural advantages: Extra Lives for a cat (it has nine lives, after all!), Mindlink and Telesend for a familiar that can transmit its thoughts, etc. 

Once you have determined the familiar’s abilities, work out its point total and its base value as an Ally. Select frequency of appearance as usual. This may be how often your familiar is available (on a failed appearance roll, it is sleeping, reporting to a demon lord, etc.) or how often its powers work (on a failure, it is no more capable than an ordinary member of its species, and cannot use or grant special powers) – your choice. 

This kind of Ally usually has one or more special modifiers. Minion, Summonable, and Sympathy are common. Unwilling is typical of demonic or otherwise evil familiars. Take Special Abilities only if your familiar grants you powers; e.g., extra Fatigue Points with which to fuel spells or exotic or supernatural advantages that emulate the familiar’s own abilities (such as Flight, for a bird). You have no access to these abilities on a failed appearance roll; if your familiar is stunned, unconscious, or dead; or in areas where your special link does not function (GM’s decision). Buy these abilities with a -40% Accessibility limitation: “Granted by familiar.”"
        Sp_lim="Sympathy: If you are stunned, knocked out, mind-controlled, etc., your Ally is similarly affected. The reverse is also true, so you should take special care of your Ally! -25% if the death of one party reduces the other to 0 HP; -50% if the death of one party automatically kills the other. If your wounds affect your Ally, but your Ally’s wounds don’t affect you, reduce these values to -5% and -10%. 

Unwilling: You have obtained your Ally through coercion (e.g., blackmail or magical binding). You do not have to treat him as well as you would a normal Ally. However, he hates you and is likely to act accordingly, reducing his overall reliability level. If you endanger such an Ally or order him to do something unpleasant, he may rebel (GM’s option) if the consequences of doing so would be less severe than those of doing your bidding. An Ally who rebels is gone, along with the points you spent on him. -50%.

Mind Bleed: Whenever you or your ally critically fail an IQ, Will, Per, or other purely based “mental” attempt, roll 3d. On a 6 or less, the character who failed his rolls suffers from a sudden infusion of thoughts, memories, mental images, etc. pouring into his head. If the effects are mild, last for 2d seconds, and causes -2 on all skills for the duration, this is -5%. If the effects are severe, last for 1d minutes, and cause -5 on all skills for the duration, it’s -10%. If the effects are crippling, last for 3d minutes, and you cannot use any skills for the duration, it’s -15%. This limitation becomes an enhancement for the Dependent disadvantage. 

Sympathy, Resistible: Being able to resist the effects of this limitation with an HT roll drops the value to -15% if the death of one party reduces the other to 0 HP, while the death of one party automatically killing the other becomes -25%. Success at the HT roll means they’re still conscious, but they suffer the effects of a Mortal Wound (p. B423). Critical success means you suffer no ill effects. At the GM’s option, this limitation can become an enhancement for the Dependent disadvantage."
        Sp_enh="Minion: Your Ally continues to serve you regardless of how well you treat him. This might be due to programming, fear, awe, or lack of self-awareness. Examples include robots, zombies, and magical slaves. You are free of the usual obligation to treat your Ally well. Mistreatment might result in an inconvenient breakdown (mental or physical), but the Ally will not leave. See Puppet (p. 78) for additional options. +0% if the Minion has IQ 0 or Slave Mentality (p. 154), as the benefits of total loyalty are offset by the need for close supervision; +50% otherwise. 

Special Abilities: Your Ally wields power out of proportion to his point value. Perhaps he has extensive political clout or access to equipment from a TL higher than your own; perhaps he grants you exotic powers. Don’t apply this enhancement simply because your Ally has exotic abilities. If his powers are very uncommon, you will already be paying extra: your Ally requires an Unusual Background, which raises his point total and his value as an Ally. +50%. 

Summonable: You conjure your Ally instead of rolling to see whether he appears at the start of an adventure. To do so, take a Concentrate maneuver and roll against frequency of appearance. On a success, your Ally appears nearby. On a failure, you cannot attempt to summon him again for one full day. Dismissing your Ally is a free action, but you may only dismiss him if he is physically present. +100%.

Conjured: As Summonable (p. B38), except that each time the advantage is used, instead of summoning the same beings, it produces different ones. The GM must make a reaction roll whenever new Allies appear, to determine their willingness to obey orders. If they’re killed, the summoner must wait a full day to call replacements. The drawbacks of conjuring entities with no memory of or devotion to the summoner offset the benefits of being able to replace slain Allies just by waiting a day, so the enhancement costs the same as Summonable. +100%."    />

Each level past the first increases this ratio by one: three times as fast at level 2, four times as fast at level 3, and so on. Each level of Altered Time Rate lets you take one additional maneuver on your turn in combat, allowing you to cast spells quickly by taking multiple Concentrate maneuvers, run very fast by taking multiple Move maneuvers, etc. Your turn doesn’t come any sooner, however! This advantage affects how fast you move when you react, but not how quickly you react in the first place. 

Out of combat, Altered Time Rate allows you the luxury of extensive planning, even in crisis situations, as everything seems to happen in slow motion. You may always attempt a Sense roll, or an IQ-based skill roll to make plans or recall information (GM’s decision), at no penalty to additional actions. 

In order to do anything that depends on someone else’s reactions, you must deliberately “slow down” and function at his speed. This applies both when making a Feint in combat and when making an Influence roll (see p. 359) out of combat. For instance, if you choose to Feint, that is all you can do on your turn – you cannot take extra actions. (On the other hand, you could make an All-Out Attack followed by an Attack in order to beat down his defenses through sheer blinding speed!)"

When performing mundane or repetitive tasks – building things (including new inventions), reading, making repairs, etc. – look up your ATR level in the Size column of the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. B550) and divide the time required by the number in the Linear Measurement column. For example, ATR 6 gives a divisor of 20, which means a repair that normally requires an hour takes you just three minutes. You can reduce time further by taking a skill penalty (see p. B346). You can’t hasten learning, special abilities (making magic items, concentrating on Mind Control, etc.), Concept rolls when inventing, or interactions with people or machines incapable of matching your speed. The GM may wish restrict Super-Speed to superheroic speedsters. +20%."

        desc="Like the werewolf of folklore, you can assume a specific form other than your own. This can be anything built with points: humanoid, animal, robot, etc. Create your alternate form as a racial template (p. 260); however, you can switch it “on” and “off.” This template need not be a “stock” template. For instance, if you wish to retain human intelligence in beast form, you could shift into a template that lacks the beast’s low IQ (although this increases the template cost and hence the cost of Alternate Form). The GM is the final judge of what templates are allowed as Alternate Forms. 
        
While it is turned on, your Alternate Form’s racial template replaces your native racial template. Apply its racial traits – attribute modifiers, racial advantages and disadvantages, etc. – instead of those of your native race. Personal traits (including all attribute levels, advantages, disadvantages, and skills bought over and above racial norms) remain intact, although your skill levels are affected by changes to the controlling attribute scores. 

If the Alternate Form’s racial template has traits that conflict with your personal traits, the traits of your Alternate Form take precedence. For instance, if you become a dolphin with No Manipulators, you will temporarily lose personal advantages that affect your hands, such as High Manual Dexterity, while you are in dolphin form – and some skills (for instance, Lockpicking) will be relatively useless, although you do remember them. 

If you have a single Alternate Form, it costs 15 points for a racial template worth no more than your native racial template. A more powerful form costs 15 points plus 90% of the difference in cost between your native template and that of your Alternate Form. 

If you have multiple forms, pay full cost for the most expensive form. The less powerful Alternate Forms cost a flat 15 points apiece. Minimum cost per form is still 15 points. 

Were-Creatures: To create the classic “were-creature,” start by purchasing any trait that applies in both forms – Infectious Attack, Vulnerability (Silver), etc. – as a personal trait. Next, buy an animal template as an Alternate Form. Since most beast templates are worth 0 or fewer points, this will usually cost 15 points, but powerful creatures (e.g., bears and tigers) may cost more. If the beast form is savage, the template should include such traits as Berserk, Bestial, and Bloodlust. Finally, apply limitations such as Emergencies Only (p. 112), Unconscious Only (p. 115), and Uncontrollable (p. 116) to Alternate Form, as applicable. If you can only change during the full moon, add a -40% Trigger limitation (p. 115) as well. 

Shapeshifting Races: When creating an entire race that has Alternate Form, work out the details of Alternate Form last. Total the cost of all the race’s traits other than Alternate Form, subtract this total from the cost of the template the race transforms into, and use the difference to calculate the cost of Alternate Form for the race. Add the cost of Alternate Form to that of the race’s other abilities to determine final racial cost.

Variation of the Shapeshifting advantage."
        Sp_lim="Cosmetic: You can assume a second, distinct appearance with no change in abilities or racial template. -50%.

Projected Form: Your Alternate Form is a separate entity – perhaps a physical manifestation of your soul. When you use your ability, your native form falls into a trance and your Alternate Form appears nearby (within 10 yards). This is a real, physical form with no special restrictions on its actions. To dismiss it and awaken, it must be within 10 yards of your native form. If either form is wounded or killed, so is the other form; see Projection (p. 44) for details. -50%.

Skinbound: You assume your Alternate Form by donning the skin of a creature of that type, which is absorbed into your body in the process. Alternatively, you take off the skin of your base form, which you must keep safe if you’re to change back. Buy either version as a set of gadget limitations, but halve their total value, as they apply only in one shape. The skin can be either an organic part of your body, which you’re supernaturally able to separate from yourself, or an artifact with uncanny powers.

Preventable: To change form, you have to speak a code phrase, make a special gesture, touch a magical talisman, or meet some other requirement. This takes no longer than the usual time, but you can be prevented from doing it by mundane methods such as gagging you. If you depend on an external physical object to make the change, you can also take suitable gadget limitations. -10%

Linked Changes: Weres only. You and another were are mystically bound together; when one of you changes shape, the other must do so also. This may take either of two forms: synchronized (either both or neither of you is in your base form) or opposed (when one of you is in his base form, the other is in his alternate form). The forms don’t need to be the same species; a man who changes into a wolf might be linked to a woman who changes into a hawk, or to a wolf that changes into a man. -25%. 

Only When Insubstantial: You can only change shape when you’re in immaterial form – for example, as a spirit, or as a projected astral body. This has several variants. If you have to become immaterial to change shape, but can retain the changed shape when material: -5%. If you automatically revert to your base form when you become material: -10%. 

Required Intermediate Form: Weres only. Normally, a were with two or more Alternate Forms can change from any form to any other directly. This limitation restricts that freedom. If an Alternate Form cannot change back to the base form directly, this is a -5% limitation. If an Alternate Form can only be reached from other forms, this is a limitation of -10% divided by the total number of other forms it can’t be reached from."

        Sp_enh="Absorptive Change: You “absorb” worn and carried items into your Alternate Form. These reappear when you change back. Without this modifier, you must leave your equipment behind when you change, and worn items too small for your Alternate Form risk destruction. Cost depends on encumbrance level: +5% for None, +10% for Light, +15% for Medium, +20% for Heavy, or +25% for ExtraHeavy. The GM decides what’s left behind if your encumbrance exceeds your capacity. Apply this modifier separately to each form that can absorb equipment.

Active Change: Your transformation takes the usual amount of time, but you needn’t concentrate during this time – you can move and act. You have the abilities of the form you’re changing from until the transition is complete. (GMs who enjoy extra detail can average the forms’ statistics, or even use a weighted average to reflect how far along the change has come.) +20%.

Non-Reciprocal Damage: Injury you suffer in one form doesn’t affect any of your other forms – although wounds only heal while you’re in the form that sustained them, unless you also take Reciprocal Rest. +50%.

Once On, Stays On: This is identical to the general modifier of the same name (see p. 109), but with a special rule for Alternate Form: it counts as a +50% modifier on the basic 15 points and raises the form-specific cost from 90% to 100% of the difference in template costs.

Reciprocal Rest: Your dormant forms can rest while they’re out of sight. Time spent dormant counts toward FP recovery and the sleep needs of that form. In conjunction with Non-Reciprocal Damage, these forms can even recover HP and recuperate from crippling injuries. This doesn’t preclude dormant forms being aware of and remembering the active form’s actions. +30%."

Each time you purchase this trait, your fingerprints (or other biometrics used to verify identity in your world) are registered under another name, and you have an extra set of identity documents (birth certificate, licenses, passport, etc.) good enough to pass close inspection. These identities may also have valid credit cards and bank accounts, but you must supply the money – additional wealth is not included in the package! 

If an intelligence or law-enforcement agency attempts to identify you with no clue as to your name – for instance, using biometrics or photoanalysis – there is an equal chance for each of your identities to come up. The search will stop . . . unless they have reason to believe you are a ringer. If the search continues, your other identities will eventually surface, and you will be unmasked. Once a government agency determines who you really are, your Alternate Identities are lost for good.

There are two types of Alternate Identity:

Legal: Some spies and undercover policemen – and even supers, in settings where they are backed by the government – may have a legal Alternate Identity. This requires at least 10 points in Legal Enforcement Powers, Legal Immunity, Police Rank, Security Clearance, etc.; the GM sets the precise prerequisites. If a super has official permission to conceal his original name (e.g., to protect his family) and to hold property in his “super” name, then that is a legal Alternate Identity combined with a Secret Identity (see p. 153). 5 points.

Illegal: A criminal or foreign agent may have an illegal Alternate Identity. This has the advantage of being completely unknown when you first start out, and of course it cannot be revoked by the government. On the other hand, should it ever be discovered, you will face a stiff fine, a jail sentence, or execution, depending on the time and place. 15 points."

Reaction modifiers due to appearance only affect members of your own race, a very similar race, or a dissimilar race that finds your race attractive (for whatever reason). In all cases, the GM’s word is final; humans are “very similar” to elves, but bug-eyed monsters are unlikely to care about a human’s appearance except in a silly campaign.

Average: Your appearance gives you no reaction modifiers either way; you can blend easily into a crowd. A viewer’s impression of your looks depends on your behavior. If you smile and act friendly, you will be remembered as pleasant-looking; if you frown and mutter, you will be remembered as unattractive. 0 points. 

Attractive: You don’t enter beauty contests, but are definitely good-looking. This gives +1 on reaction rolls. 4 points. 

Handsome (or Beautiful): You could enter beauty contests. This gives +4 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your sex, +2 from everyone else. 12 points. 

Very Handsome (or Very Beautiful): You could win beauty contests – regularly. This gives +6 on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your sex, +2 from others. Exception: Members of the same sex with reason to dislike you (more than -4 in reaction penalties, regardless of bonuses) resent your good looks, and react at -2 instead. As well, talent scouts, friendly drunks, slave traders, and other nuisances are liable to become a problem for you. 16 points. 

Transcendent: You are an “ideal specimen.” This gives +8 (!) on reaction rolls made by those attracted to members of your sex, +2 from others, and all the troublesome side effects of Very Handsome.

Special Options The following options are available for above-average appearance, and do not affect point costs: 

Androgynous: If your appearance is Handsome (Beautiful) or better, you may specify that your looks appeal equally to both sexes. You get a flat reaction modifier instead of a sexdependent bonus: +3 for Handsome, +4 for Very Handsome, or +5 for Transcendent.

Binding is a ranged attack with 1/2D –, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1. You can add modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). 

On a hit, your victim is grappled (see p. 370) and rooted in place. He cannot select the Move or Change Posture maneuvers or change facing, and is at -4 to DX. The ST of this effect is equal to your Binding level, but you can layer additional attacks on a successfully bound victim. Each extra layer gives +1 to ST. 

To break free, the victim must win a Quick Contest of ST or Escape skill against the ST of your Binding. Each attempt takes one second. If the victim fails to break free, he loses 1 FP but may try again. Alternatively, he may try to destroy the Binding. Innate Attacks hit automatically; other attacks are at -4. External attacks on the Binding take no penalty, but risk hitting the victim on a miss (see Striking Into a Close Combat, p. 392). The Binding has DR equal to 1/3 your level (rounded down). Each point of damage reduces ST by one. At ST 0, the Binding is destroyed and the victim is freed.

Sticky: Your Binding is treated as Persistent (p. 107), but only affects those who actually touch the original target of your attack. +20%. 

Unbreakable: Your Binding cannot be destroyed. The only way to escape is to break free. +40%.

Constricting: Your Binding actively constricts the victim. Until he breaks free, the Binding attacks him each turn with a Constriction Attack (p. B43), at a ST equal to that of the Binding. +75%.

Suffocating: Your Binding cocoons the target or blocks his breathing passages. While it’s in place, the victim cannot breathe. If he runs out of breath before he breaks free (see Holding Your Breath, p. B351), he starts to suffocate; see Suffocation (p. B436). +75%.

Super-Binding: Through massive effort, you can create elaborately layered bonds and snares. This counts as extra effort, costing 1 FP per attempt. When you try this, ignore the normal extra-effort rules.

In the appropriate situation, members of the group should be easy to find (14 or less after 1d-1 hours of searching), but the chance of meeting one at random is small (6 or less to meet one in a small crowd in an appropriate place). 

Claim to Hospitality mainly saves the cost and trouble of finding lodging while “on the road” (although if you are wealthy, you might be expected to give gifts to your hosts), but there are side benefits. Members of the group are friendly to each other (+3 reactions), and may provide advice, introductions, and small loans, if asked.

Second Nature: Your ability is reflexive. You can initiate it as a free action and change viewpoints as quickly as you can shift your gaze.

This advantage does not allow your body to perform more than one task. A normal character may select one maneuver on his turn in combat. This may be physical or mental. Each level of Compartmentalized Mind adds one extra mental maneuver to this allotment. For instance, Compartmentalized Mind 1 would let you perform one mental maneuver and one physical maneuver (e.g., Concentrate on a spell and Attack) or two mental maneuvers (e.g., Concentrate on two spells), but never more than one physical maneuver – for that, see Extra Attack (p. 53).

        category="Exótica"
        desc="You can shape and move a particular category of matter, energy, or force (your “element”). The higher your level of Control, the larger the quantity you can affect. Cost per level depends on how significant your element is likely to be on an adventure:
        
Common: An extremely broad or prevalent category such as Earth (including asphalt, brick, ceramic, concrete, and rock, but not purified metals), Fire, Gravity, Light, Metal, Plastic (any manufactured structural material that’s neither Earth nor Metal, including oil-based plastics and rubber), Sound, Water (including steam and ice), or Wood (dead plant matter, but not fossils, oil, etc.). 20 points/level.

Occasional: A broad subcategory of a Common element, such as Ceramics (including glass), Ferrous Metals (iron, nickel, and cobalt – and note that steel is made of iron), Ice, Steam (all hot or cold water vapor), or Stone (brick, concrete, and rock). Most forms of energy are Common, but the GM might allow Infrared, Ultrasonics, and so on at this rarity level. 15 points/level.

Rare: Any relatively specific substance not already given as Common or Occasional, such as Brick, Iron, Paper, or Rubber. 10 points/level.

The GM should price other elements by comparison, and may allow “Very Common” categories (e.g., “All electromagnetic radiation”) for 25 or 30 points/level. Control isn’t available for machinery or living beings; to create animal-, plant-, and machine-control abilities, modify advantages such as Mind Control and Possession. Control over complex processes (e.g., chemical reactions) requires an entire power – not just a single Control ability.

Limits of Control

The most important limit on Control is that you can only use it if your element is present. Control does nothing without your element, and doesn’t let you call your element into existence (for that, buy Create).

For solids and liquids, you can affect up to 10 x (level squared) lbs. of matter in the form of a single object or amorphous mass. For example, Control 3 (Iron) would let you affect a 90-lb. iron ingot or even 90 lbs. of iron filings in a heap . . . but against a foe with a 3-lb. sword, 4-lb. helmet, and 18-lb. breastplate, all iron, you could only affect one target, even though the total weight is much less than your limit.

For gases, energy, and forces – and diffuse, airborne solids, like dust clouds – you can affect a circular area with a radius equal to your level in yards. Should height matter, the area is four yards tall. The target item must be continuous. For instance, Control 10 (Fire) would let you control a blaze 10 yards in radius, but not “all candle flames within 10 yards.”

Finally, Control over matter doesn’t work on complex, manufactured artifacts unless they’re made almost entirely of your element. Control (Metal) could affect a sword or a revolver, but not a ray gun with only a few metallic parts.

Establishing Control

To control solids or liquids, you must touch the target object or material. This takes a second and requires a successful unarmed melee attack. If someone is wearing or carrying the target item, he may defend against your touch. If your touch succeeds, make an immediate IQ roll to establish control.

To control gases, energy, or forces, you must reach into or stand within the desired area of effect. To establish control, take a Concentrate maneuver and make an IQ roll.

If your target is already under someone else’s direct control, roll a Quick Contest. You roll against IQ; they roll against IQ if using Control or Telekinesis, their skill level if using a spell, and so on. You must win to establish control. Likewise, others can overpower your Control by winning a Quick Contest against your IQ.

Effects of Control

After establishing control, you can reshape the target. Forming a simple shape (blob, column, sphere, etc.) requires a Concentrate maneuver but no die roll. If the result is meant to be beautiful or functional, though, the GM may deem the effort a long task (see p. B346) and require skill rolls against Armoury, Artist, Machinist, and so on. You can work without tools, but you must know what you’re doing.

You can also cause the target to elongate or flow at a Move equal to your Control level. This requires constant concentration. The target needn’t remain in contact with you, but Control isn’t Telekinesis. You can make a solid or liquid ooze, roll, or seep along the ground or a surface, and even reshape it in ways that defy gravity, but only gas or energy can actually fly through the air – and you can’t “shape” a force at all.

For energy, each level of Control gives the effect of one two-dimensional reflector or insulator with length and width in yards no larger than your Control level. For instance, Control 3 (Light) would let you route light around obstacles as if you had three mirrors up to 3 yards x 3 yards in size, or block light completely as if you had three 3 yard x 3 yard screens.

For a force, each level of Control lets you adjust the force’s strength by ±10% within your radius; e.g., Control 10 (Gravity) could make everything weightless (-100%) or double all weights (+100%), with effects as described in Different Gravity (p. B350). This only affects the gross force on entire objects. To disintegrate things by reducing internal binding forces, buy an Innate Attack.

Control includes the ability to make minor, “cosmetic” changes. For instance, Control (Light) can give a colored cast to everything in the area, and Control (Metal) can clean corrosion off metal and make it gleam. You can produce such effects incidentally when reshaping or moving your element.

When you stop concentrating, you immediately give up control. Stable forms become permanent, while unstable ones collapse instantly.

Control in Combat

Defensively, Control over matter lets you move or shape your element to obstruct attacks. This requires a Concentrate maneuver. Such barriers give whatever cover the material normally provides. For instance, Control (Metal) might let you shape a steel table into armor with the DR of steel by making an Armoury roll, while Control (Earth) could stir up a sand cloud, with the usual effects on vision and lasers.

Control over energy or force is too slow to stop damage, but a Concentrate maneuver lets you eliminate -1 per level in combat penalties or add +1 per level to resistance rolls – your choice – for you and any allies in your area of effect, as long as you can explain the effects in terms of your element. For instance, with Control 5 (Light), you could focus available light onto all foes in your area, allowing your side to ignore up to -5 in darkness penalties . . . or throw up a barrier that gives everyone behind it +5 HT to resist blinding flashes.

Offensively, Control is more limited. By concentrating, you can move an existing hazard – gas, fire, radiation, etc., as befits your element – onto a foe, but this is only as harmful as the underlying substance. Nonhazardous liquids or solids merely impede his movement, like any object of that weight. In all cases, your foe can dodge.

Getting Tricky: If a foe is standing in an area where you control matter, energy, or a force – or if you can move matter or energy onto him – you may inflict combat penalties on him. This requires flexibility on the GM’s part: Control 3 (Sound) might give -3 to Hearing rolls (e.g., to detect a ninja sneaking up), Control 10 (Earth) might cause a mini-earthquake good for -10 to attack rolls, and Control (Gravity) would simply produce the usual penalties that go along with reduced or elevated gravity. Tricks like this require a Concentrate maneuver and an IQ or Tactics roll."
        Sp_lim="Cosmetic: You can only make superficial changes, such as tinting the color of light or putting a shine on metal. You can’t truly move or reshape your element. -80%."
        Sp_enh="Persistent (+40%) lets the effects of Control endure for 10 seconds after you stop concentrating. Ranged (+40%) allows you to use Control at a distance. You can’t add the Area Effect enhancement, though; to affect more of your element, buy a higher level of Control. Additional enhancements include:
        
Collective: You aren’t limited to a single object or continuous area. Your ability affects all instances of your element in a circle with a radius equal to your level in yards. You still can’t affect more than 10 x (level squared) lbs. of a solid or liquid. For instance, Control 2 (Metal) with Collective lets you affect up to 40 lbs. of any one metal in a two-yard circle; in the example under Limits of Control, you could affect the sword, helmet, and breastplate. Collective is unnecessary for forces, which already work this way – a fair trade for the fact that you can’t reshape them. +100%.

Natural Phenomena: Your element is a large-scale aspect of nature. On an earthlike world, Oceans and Weather are Common; subcategories such as Currents, Precipitation, Waves, and Winds are Occasional; and phenomena like Hail and Snow are Rare. The GM sets rarity elsewhere. This ability isn’t Create; it only works if the necessary air, water, etc. are present. Area of effect is 0.1 x level miles in radius. If your roll succeeds, every three full levels of Control let you produce effects that give -1 or +1 to rolls your element could hinder or help, relative to the prevailing conditions. You can apply this modifier to Influence rolls (to impress others), Survival rolls, Strategy rolls, and anything else the GM allows. Be sure to describe the effects you’re producing. The GM may overrule you if the rules or common sense suggest that these conditions are outside the range of modifiers you can produce. For instance, Control 10 (Oceans) could roughen or calm seas in a 1-mile radius, for ±3 to die rolls. In rough water that gives -4 to Boating rolls, you could specify any modifier between -1 (a little foam) and -7 (huge breakers). +100%.

Super-Effort: By spending one FP in extra effort, you can greatly magnify the effects of your Control. Find your level of Control in the Base Value column of the Super-Abilities Table (see p. 146), and read over to the Supervalue column. That is the number of levels of control you can apply through extra effort; this replaces the normal extra effort rule. You still cannot control something that isn’t there, or inflict more damage than is naturally possible to whatever you control. +400%."

Broader Contact Groups are not allowed. 

You may request information from a Contact Group exactly as you would an individual Contact, using the same rules for frequency of appearance, effective skill, and reliability. The difference is that a Contact Group’s effective skill reflects ability at an entire category of skills – e.g., “business skills” if your Contact Group is a corporation, or “military skills” if your Contact Group is a military unit – as opposed to one specific skill. You must define this area of knowledge when you purchase the Contact Group, and it must be appropriate to the organization.

For instance, a police Contact Group could provide ballistics comparisons, criminal profiles, legal advice, police records, and introductions to criminals. It would not specifically use Forensics, Criminology, Law, Administration, or Streetwise skills for this, but the information provided might be appropriate to any of these “police skills.”

        desc="You have an associate who provides you with useful information, or who does small (pick any two of “quick,” “nonhazardous,” and “inexpensive”) favors for you. The point value of a Contact is based on the skill he uses to assist you, the frequency with which he provides information or favors, and his reliability as a person. 

Effective Skill of Contact: First, decide on the type of Contact you have. He might be anything from a wino in the right gutter to a head of state, depending on your background. What is important is that he has access to information, knows you, and is likely to react favorably. (Of course, offering cash or favors is never a bad idea; the GM will set the Contact’s “price.”) Next, choose the useful skill your Contact provides. This skill must match the Contact’s background; e.g., Finance for a banker or Forensics for a lab technician. Since the GM rolls against this skill when you request aid from your Contact, you should select a skill that can provide the results you expect. If you want ballistics comparisons, take a Contact with Forensics, not Finance! After that, select an effective skill level. This reflects the Contact’s connections, other skills, Status, etc. It need not be his actual skill level (the GM will set this, if it matters). For instance, the president of a local steel mill might have business-related skills of 12-14, but his effective skill might be 18 because of his position in the company. This skill level determines the Contact’s base cost: 
Effective Skill 12: 1 point; 
Effective Skill 15: 2 points; 
Effective Skill 18: 3 points; 
Effective Skill 21: 4 points. 

Add 1 point to these costs for Contacts who can obtain information using supernatural talents (ESP, magical divination, etc.). This is common for spirits, wizards, etc. 

Frequency of Appearance: Select a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36), and apply its multiplier to the base cost of the Contact. When you wish to reach your Contact, the GM rolls against his frequency of appearance. On a failure, the Contact is busy or cannot be located that day. On a 17 or 18, the Contact cannot be reached for the entire adventure! On a success, the GM will roll against the Contact’s effective skill once per piece of information or minor favor you request. No Contact may be reached more than once per day, even if several PCs share the same Contact. If you have several questions to ask, you should have them all in mind when you first reach your Contact. The Contact answers the first question at his full effective skill. Each subsequent question is at a cumulative -2. Don’t overuse your Contacts! A Contact can never supply information outside his area of knowledge. Use common sense. Likewise, the GM must not allow a Contact to give information that short-circuits an important part of the adventure. You must explain how you normally get in touch with your Contact. Regardless of frequency of appearance, you cannot reach your Contact if those channels are closed. 

Reliability: Contacts are not guaranteed to be truthful. Reliability multiplies the Contact’s point cost as follows: Completely Reliable: Even on a critical failure on his effective skill roll, the Contact’s worst response will be “I don’t know.” On an ordinary failure, he can find information in 1d days. x3. Usually Reliable: On a critical failure, the Contact lies. On any other failure, he doesn’t know now, “. . . but check back in (1d) days.” Roll again at that time; a failure then means he can’t find out at all. x2. Somewhat Reliable: On a failure, the Contact doesn’t know and can’t find out. On a critical failure, he lies – and on a natural 18, he lets the opposition or authorities (as appropriate) know who is asking questions. x1. Unreliable: Reduce effective skill by 2. On any failure, he lies; on a critical failure, he notifies the enemy. x1/2 (round up; minimum final cost is 1 point). 

Money Talks: Bribery, whether cash or favors, motivates a Contact and increases his reliability level. Once reliability reaches “usually reliable,” further levels of increase go to effective skill; bribery cannot make anyone completely reliable! A cash bribe should be about equivalent to one day’s income for a +1 bonus, one week’s income for +2, one month’s for +3, and one year’s for +4. Favors should be of equivalent worth, and should always be something that you actually play out in the game. The bribe must also be appropriate to the Contact. A diplomat would be insulted by a cash bribe, but might welcome an introduction into the right social circle. A criminal might ask for cash but settle for favors that could get you in trouble. A police detective or wealthy executive might simply want you to “owe him one” for later . . . which could set off a whole new adventure, somewhere down the road.

Contacts in Play: You may add new Contacts in play, provided you can come up with a good in-game justification. The GM might even turn an existing NPC into a Contact for one or more PCs – possibly in lieu of character points for the adventure in which the PCs developed the NPC as a Contact. For instance, the reward for an adventure in which the party helped solve a bank robbery might be a knowledgeable, reliable police Contact. 

Examples of Contacts: The list of all possible Contacts – and their skills – would fill an entire book. Here are just a few examples: Business. Business owners, executives, secretaries, and even the mailroom flunky can supply information on business dealings. They generally provide a business skill, such as Accounting, Administration, or Finance. A mail boy or typist might have effective skill 12; the president’s secretary has skill 15; a senior executive or accountant has skill 18; and the CEO, president, or chairman of the board has skill 21. Military. This could be anyone from an enlisted grunt to a general. Such Contacts might provide information on troop movements, details on secret weapons or tactics, or top-level strategy. This could take the form of Savoir-Faire (Military), Strategy, or Tactics skill – or perhaps a technical skill, such as Engineer. A Rank 0 soldier would have effective skill 12, a Rank 1-2 NCO would have skill 15, a Rank 3-5 officer would have skill 18, and a Rank 6 or higher officer would have skill 21. Police. Anyone connected with law enforcement and criminal investigations: beat cops, corporate security, government agents, forensics specialists, coroners, etc. Typical skills are Criminology, Forensics, Intelligence Analysis, and Law. Beat cops and regular private security officers have effective skill 12; detectives, federal agents, and records clerks are skill 15; administrators (lieutenants, captains, Special Agents in Charge, etc.) are skill 18; and senior officers (sheriffs, chiefs of police, District Superintendents, Security Chiefs, etc.) are skill 21. Street. Thugs, fences, gang members, mobsters, and the like can provide information on illicit activities, local criminal gossip, upcoming crimes, etc. Most provide Streetwise skill. “Unconnected” crooks (those who are not part of the local criminal organization) have effective skill 12; “connected” ones are skill 15; mob lieutenants and other powerful criminals are skill 18; and an actual crime lord (e.g., the Don, clan chief, or Master of the Thieves’ Guild) has skill 21."

You’re a member of a group that trains together so often that synchronization of action is second nature to you. You must specialize by a particular group of people or team. Levels higher than two are cinematic.

To use this advantage, everyone in the squad must take a Ready maneuver to “form up.” After that, the entire group acts at the same point in the combat sequence as its slowest member. On the team’s collective turn, each member may choose his actions freely, and may do one of the following.

• Synchronize: If two or more characters are using the same skill (e.g., Stealth or Climbing), they may help other team members by simply being nearby and offering minor assistance. First, start with the highest skill level among the adventurers and then add a bonus equal to (number of teammates that have at least one point in the skill) - (number of teammates who do not have the skill) + (the lowest level of Coordinated Action among the characters). This bonus applies to all members of the team that are relying on the skill. If using Complementary Skills (Social Engineering, p. 21), the GM should allow those who are assisting their teammates to gain a bonus to any skill roll used to complement another, equal to their level in this advantage.

• Overwhelm: When attacking a single target, each team member beyond the first who hits inflicts a cumulative -2 to active defenses (or half this penalty on resistance rolls) against all attacks. This penalty may never be larger than twice the minimum level of Coordinated Action. Halve this penalty (dropping fractions) if the target has Enhanced Time Sense. For example, if three soldiers with Coordinated Action 2 attack, they can cause at most -2 to active defenses or -1 to resistance rolls – or -1 to defenses and no resistance penalty if the target has Enhanced Time Sense.

• Pulling Together: If combining ST for an ST roll or to cause damage to an object (e.g., with small battering ram), use the highest ST plus the lowest level of this advantage plus 1/5 the total of the other ST scores (round up). If working together to lift a weight, add together everyone’s Basic Lift and increase the final amount by 5% of the lowest level of this advantage. The GM may extend this advantage to similar tasks. For instance, digging a hole or building a wall could easily benefit from such cooperation; use the above guidelines for physically intensive tasks that require no skill or reduce the time required for a Long Task by 5% per level of this advantage.

• Wound: Team members can all attempt to attack the same hit location, “adding” their attacks. This doesn’t actually increase the amount of injury a highly armored target takes, but it does increase the secondary effects of damage (e.g., blunt trauma, knockback, setting things on fire, DR lost to corrosive attacks, and so on). Apply the target’s DR separately to each attack for determining injury – but add conjoint attacks that don’t penetrate DR when assessing other effects. After working out the final HP of injury inflicted by each attack – taking into account DR, damage type, hit location, etc. – add the injuries together and treat them as a single wound for shock, knockdown, stunning, crippling, and anything else that depends on wound size. This lets harassers with relatively weak attacks inflict major wounds on opponents with high DR . . . or blow apart a foe with Supernatural Durability. All active characters must have Coordinated Action at a level equal to the number of participating characters. For example, if two characters are using flamethrowers to attack an zombie, they could concentrate their onslaught on the zombie’s head. Although this might not do a lot of damage immediately, it would be additive to determine if the zombie’s head catches fire (see Making Things Burn, p. B433)!

* Those with Enhanced Time Sense (p. B52) reduce these costs to 9 points for the first level and 6 points per level thereafter."

        pts="Variable"
        type="Mental"
        category="Exótica"
        desc="You can create an “element” – a specific category of matter or energy – out of nothing. To do so, take a Concentrate maneuver and roll vs. IQ. Success means your element appears. A solid or liquid coalesces in hand or within arm’s reach, while gas or energy appears in the area surrounding you or in an area you’re touching (your choice in both cases). Failure means nothing happens. Critical failure means your element appears, but in a way that’s inconvenient or dangerous – the GM should be creative! Creating something out of nothing is hard. Each attempt, successful or not, requires 2 FP. There’s also a character point cost for permanent creation (see below).

Your level of Create determines how much of your element you can conjure. Point cost per level is a function of the breadth of your ability, not the rarity of your element:

Large Category: Solid, Liquid, and Gas let you create any matter that’s naturally in that state in your present environment. Organic and Inorganic let you create any material of the appropriate category, in the state it normally takes in your environment. Important options for energy are Electromagnetic Waves (all EM radiation) and Physical Waves (all sound and vibration). 40 points/level.

Medium Category: A broad subset of a single Large category, or the area of overlap between two Large categories, or a specific class of manufactured substances. Acid, Biochemicals, Drugs, Earth, and Metal qualify. Options for energy include Electricity, Sound, Long-Wave EM (radio, microwaves, and far IR), Light (IR, visible, and UV), and Short-Wave EM (far UV, X-rays, and gamma rays). A dramatically important category that includes aspects of matter and energy is Radiation (alpha and beta particles, gamma rays, etc.). 20 points/level.

Small Category: A narrow subset of a Large category, or a broad subset of a Medium category, or one fairly specific material that comes in many varieties. Useful examples include Ferrous Metals (iron, nickel, and cobalt), Fire (any incandescent gas), Fossil Fuels (coal, natural gas, oil, etc.), and Wood – and, for energy, things like Gamma Rays, Infrared, Ultrasonics, and Visible Light. 10 points/level.

Specific Item: A single chemical element or compound, such as Iron, Salt, or Water, or a commonly occurring mixture, such as Air or Brine. You can choose nasty materials such as Plutonium, TNT, and VX Gas, but you won’t necessarily be able to create a useful amount. 5 points/level.

Limits on Quantity

There are strict limits on the amount of matter or energy you can create:
•Solids and liquids can weigh up to 10 x (level squared) lbs. – 10 lbs. at level 1, 40 lbs. at level 2, 90 lbs. at level 3, and so on.
• Gases can fill an area up to one yard in radius per level.
• Energy appears in a quantity sufficient to do 1,000 x (level squared) kJ of useful work, released too gradually to inflict damage. The GM should limit power output to 15 kW or so. To store this energy, you need a battery or equivalent technology.

Created matter (but not energy) is unstable. It vanishes in 10 seconds unless you use character points to “stabilize” it. Each point spent stabilizes a quantity worth 10% of the campaign’s average starting wealth. (This is just the tradeoff used for Trading Points for Money, p. B26.) The GM determines the cash value per pound of matter – a ton of gold costs more to stabilize than a ton of sand.

Points spent to stabilize matter come from your “Creation Pool,” a number of points set aside for the purpose. You can’t apply any modifiers to these points. Points used to stabilize matter are unavailable until reclaimed – which causes the matter to vanish. If the matter is crafted into an object, the item is unmade when the matter vanishes. If the matter is mixed with other materials (e.g., alloyed), you must separate it to reclaim your points; this can be a tedious process. If it’s destroyed or transformed (e.g., eaten), you can’t reclaim your points – they’re gone. You can increase your Creation Pool with unspent points at any time.

If economics are unimportant to the campaign, the GM is free to waive point costs for permanent matter. Alternatively, he can require those with Create to start with Wealth or Independent Income – or a Vow never to use Create to produce wealth.

If your ability lets you create a dangerous element, you can opt to create a minuscule amount in combat without worrying about long-term stability. It just produces its effects and vanishes, like matter or energy projected by an Innate Attack. The following effects are possible, provided your element includes suitable materials:

• Corrosive solids and liquids appear in quantity and concentration sufficient to inflict 1d corrosion damage per level, once, on a single subject. You must immerse a victim in the substance or throw it at him to do damage.
• Poisonous solids and liquids appear in a dosage sufficient to inflict 1d toxic damage per level on one subject. Method of delivery, delay, resistance rolls, cycles, and so on are as usual for the poison (see Poison Examples, p. B439). Damage is total damage, over all cycles.
• Noxious gases fill a circular area with a radius in yards equal to your level, to a height of four yards, for 10 seconds. They affect everyone exposed. Use the rules for noxious solids and liquids (poisonous or corrosive, as appropriate), but total damage is 1 point per level. Convert 4 points or more of damage to dice (see p. B269).
• Fire and hazardous energy (electricity, microwaves, intense sound, etc.) fill an area identical to that for a noxious gas, and inflict 1 point of damage of a suitable type per level each second on anyone who stays in the area for at least a second. Convert 4+ points of damage to dice. DR protects normally. Energy dissipates after 10 seconds, but fires it sets burn for as long as they have fuel, devices it overloads remain broken, and so on – these effects don’t vanish with the energy.
• Radioactive materials work as poisonous ones. Radiation fields use the rules for hazardous energy. All “damage” is in rads.
• Explosives appear in quantity sufficient to cause a blast that inflicts 1 point of crushing damage per level, and vanish if not detonated within 10 seconds.

If the element would cause an effect other than damage – blindness for bright light, deafness for loud sound, etc. – treat it like an Affliction instead. The HT roll to resist is at -1 per level of Create for a single subject, -1 per three full levels for an area.

Energy or matter created as an attack is by definition of a quantity and potency that produces the above effects and then vanishes. Such rapid dispersal is totally unrealistic for substances lethal in microscopic doses . . . but no less realistic than the ability to conjure your element in the first place.

Other Restrictions

Create lets you conjure anything in your category. This may give access to several of the options above; e.g., Create (Electricity) could charge a battery or fill an area with lightning, while Create (Organic) could produce corrosives, poisons, or explosives. You must specify exactly what you’re creating, and for what purpose, before you roll the dice. If you don’t, the GM decides what happens . . .

If it isn’t clear which limit applies – or if more than one limit could apply – the GM selects the one that best suits your intentions and the demands of drama.

Create produces bulk matter, not specific shapes, much less machines. To create pre-shaped matter, buy both Create and Control (p. 90), and connect them with a Link. Such a combination can create machines; this is a long task (see p. B346) that requires skill rolls, as explained for Control. The GM can bend these rules as needed – but be warned that ignoring Limits on Quantity can unbalance a campaign."
        Sp_lim="—"
        Sp_enh="To conjure “essential” elements like those created by the Essential Fire and Essential Water spells in GURPS Magic, add Cosmic, +50%. Ranged (+40%) lets Create work at a distance, but never inside a foe. The GM might even permit attack enhancements for elements useful in combat. Area Effect and Extended Duration are off limits, however. To blanket a wider area, buy more levels of Create. To keep matter around indefinitely, use your Creation Pool. Additional enhancements include:
        
Destruction: You can destroy your element, subject to the same restrictions on type and quantity described for creation under Limits on Quantity. To destroy something, you must touch it (or stand amidst it, for gas or energy), take a Concentrate maneuver, and pay 2 FP. Then make an IQ roll. Success means the target is gone. You don’t have to spend character points to do this. Destruction only affects inanimate objects. +100% if you can also create your element; +0% if you can only destroy it.

Transmutation: You can convert existing matter or energy into another form. The quantities involved depend on your level. Work out the limits as usual for the initial and final items, and use the smaller of the two. If the product is worth more than what you started with, it’s unstable and will revert to its original form after 10 seconds unless you stabilize it with your Creation Pool – in which case point cost depends on the difference in value. This might be why alchemists can’t transmute large amounts of lead into gold! Transmutation costs 1 FP per use. Otherwise, it works like unmodified Create. +50% per transmutation, which can be within your category or between your category and another of the same size, in one direction. For instance, Create (Metal) could have Metal to Metal, Metal to Earth, or Earth to Metal for +50% apiece; any two for +100%; or all three for +150%. Add -100% if you can only transmute, not create; if so, you can’t also take Destruction."

Normal humans cannot purchase DR at all. Creatures with natural armor can buy DR 1 to 5. Thick skin or a pelt would be DR 1; pig hide, armadillo shell, a heavy pelt, or scales like those of a lizard would be DR 2; rhinoceros hide or a pangolin’s armor plates would be DR 3; alligator scales or elephant hide would be DR 4; and a giant tortoise would have DR 5. Robots, supers, supernatural entities, etc. can purchase any amount of DR, subject to GM approval. Many special modifiers are available to change the basic assumptions of this advantage."
        Sp_lim="Ablative: Your DR stops damage once. Each point of DR stops one point of basic damage but is destroyed in the process. Lost DR “heals” at the same rate as lost HP (including the effects of Regeneration, p. 80). Use this to represent supers who can absorb massive punishment but who lack the mass to justify a large HP score. -80%. 

Can’t Wear Armor: Your body is designed in such a way that you cannot or will not wear body armor or clothing. -40%. 

Directional: Your DR only protects against attacks from one direction. -20% for the front (F); -40% for the back (B), right (R), left (L), top (T), or underside (U). Humanoids may only take this limitation for front and back. 

Flexible: Your DR is not rigid. This leaves you vulnerable to blunt trauma (see p. 379). -20%. 

Limited: Your DR applies only to certain attack forms or damage types. See Limited Defenses (box) for details. 

Partial: Your DR only protects a specific hit location. This is worth -10% per -1 penalty to hit that body part (see p. 398). For instance, an animal with butting horns and a thick skull might have “Skull only,” for -70%. “Torso only” is -10%, and also protects the vital organs. When you take this limitation for arms, legs, hands, or feet, the DR protects all limbs of that type. If it only protects one limb, the limitation value doubles (e.g., arms are -2 to hit, so a single arm would be -40%). If you have arms, legs, etc. with different penalties, use the least severe penalty to calculate limitation value. Semi-Ablative: When an attack strikes semi-ablative DR, every 10 points of basic damage rolled removes one point of DR, regardless of whether the attack penetrates DR. Lost DR “heals” as for Ablative (and you cannot combine the two). -20%. 

Tough Skin: By default, Damage Resistance is “hard”: armor plate, chitin, etc. With this limitation, your DR is merely tough skin. Any effect that requires a scratch (e.g., poison) or skin contact (e.g., electrical shock or Pressure Points skill) affects you if the attack carrying it penetrates the DR of any armor you are wearing – even if it does exactly 0 damage! Your natural DR, being living tissue, provides no protection at all against such attacks. This limitation includes all the effects of the Flexible limitation (see above); you cannot take both. It is mutually incompatible with Force Field. -40%.

Bane: Your DR doesn’t protect you from a specific attack or material. The limitation value depends on the bane’s rarity (p. B46): -15% for a “Very Common” flaw, -10% for a “Common” one, or -5% for an “Occasional” one. Failure against something “Rare” is merely a quirk."
        Sp_enh="Absorption: You can absorb damage and use it to enhance your abilities. Each point of DR stops one point of damage and turns it into one character point that you can use to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily. You store these points in a “battery” with capacity equal to DR (e.g., DR 10 gives a 10-point battery). Once this battery is full, each point of DR will still stop one point of damage, but will not convert it into a character point. You do not have to use stored points immediately, but you cannot reallocate points once used. You lose absorbed points – unused ones first – at the rate of one point per second. You lose enhanced abilities as the points drain away. (Exception: If you are missing HP or FP, you can heal yourself. Restoring one HP drains 2 stored points immediately; restoring one FP drains 3 points. Such healing is permanent. Only HP or FP in excess of your usual scores drain away.) You cannot absorb damage from your own ST or attack abilities. +80% if absorbed points can only enhance one trait (determined when you create your character) or can only heal; +100% if you can raise any trait. 

Force Field: Your DR takes the form of a field projected a short distance from your body. This protects your entire body – including your eyes – as well as anything you are carrying, and reduces the damage from attacks before armor DR. Effects that rely on touch (such as many magic spells) only affect you if carried by an attack that does enough damage to pierce your DR. +20%. 

Hardened: Each level of Hardened reduces the armor divisor of an attack by one step. These steps are, in order: “ignores DR,” 100, 10, 5, 3, 2, and 1 (no divisor). +20% per level. 

Reflection: Your DR “bounces back” any damage it stops at your attacker. The remaining damage affects you normally. The attacker doesn’t get an active defense against the first attack you reflect back at him, but gets his usual defenses against subsequent reflected attacks. Reflection only works vs. direct hits! It cannot reflect damage from explosions, fragments, poison gas, or anything else that affects an entire area. This enhancement is mutually exclusive with Absorption. +100%.

Malediction-Proof: Your DR also reduces the damage you take from Innate Attacks with the Malediction enhancement. This must be combined with a version of Limited restricting it to one power source (e.g., psi) or with the +50% defensive version of Cosmic. +50%, or +0% if it only protects against Maledictions."

You can be grievously wounded – even maimed – under other circumstances, but you will not die.

The sea might flood your home while you sleep, the general against whom you march might be the future emperor, or Mt. Vesuvius might bury you under tons of ash. 10 points.

Minor Advantage: You are fated to play a small part in a larger story, but this part will reflect to your credit. In game terms, you are guaranteed one significant victory. 5 points.

You can reliably get the attention of your deity to ask for miracles. This requires at least 1d seconds of silent prayer, during which you must decide if you are making a general prayer (p. 5) or specific prayer (p. 6). (There is a third type of prayer – the learned prayer, p. 6 – but it does not use these rules.) In combat, prayer requires you to take successive Concentrate maneuvers.

While you pray, the GM secretly makes a petition roll against your level of Divine Favor, adjusted by any applicable Divine Favor modifiers (p. 5). This is not a success roll; you may not use Luck and cannot critically succeed or fail. If he rolls less than or equal to your modified level on 3d, your god hears you! If not, your god is too busy to notice you and there is no effect; further petition rolls are at a cumulative -1 until five minutes have passed. (Because the GM rolls everything secretly, you will not realize you were unheard until after six full seconds of prayer.)

See p.4 (Powers - Divine Favor).

* Levels 1-3 do not exist; this advantage starts at level 4 and ends at level 16.

Example: Brother Brant needs a miracle. He has Divine Favor 7, is standing in his church while praying loudly, and succeeds at a Religious Ritual roll. The GM rolls 1d and gets a 3; thus, after three consecutive seconds of prayer, the GM makes a petition roll on 3d. The target number is 7 (Divine Favor) + 1 (loud prayer and Religious Ritual) + 1 (high sanctity). If the GM rolls 9 or less, Brother Brant’s god hears the prayer.

If you are heard, the GM will then secretly make a reaction roll (pp. B559-562) on behalf of your god, applying only the Divine Favor modifiers (p. 5); standard reaction modifiers do not apply to this roll and you may not use Luck. With the GM’s permission, you may be able to buy Power Investiture (Divine Favor) to add to this roll; see Power and Privilege (p. 7).

The reaction obtained will determine your deity’s response, depending on what kind of miracle you were asking for."

This trait is only appropriate for supernatural beings that spread their “curse” through infection, and only affects members of susceptible races (typically your original race and very similar races). The GM is the judge of which curses are spread this way and who is susceptible. 
		
When you buy Dominance, you must specify one natural attack – Claws, Innate Attack, Vampiric Bite, etc. – that delivers the infection. Anyone you damage this way must roll 3d vs. the HP of injury he received (maximum one roll per day). If he rolls under the damage amount, he becomes infected, and will change into the same kind of creature as you in 2d days, or at the GM’s discretion, without suitable supernatural intervention. The GM is free to impose additional conditions for infection; for instance, the victim might have to suffer three attacks, or share your blood, or even die before making the roll above. 

Once the transition is complete, the victim acquires your supernatural racial template (Vampire, Werewolf, etc.) plus Slave Mentality (p. 154). He becomes your subordinate. If he goes on to infect others, his victims will acquire the same traits and serve you as well. 

Dominance itself costs 20 points, but to control a new victim, you must have sufficient unspent points to buy him as an Ally (p. 36) with the enhancements “Minion” (due to his Slave Mentality) and “Special Abilities” (because he can create new servitors for you). You can choose any frequency of appearance, and may improve this later on with earned points. If you lack the points to buy you victim as an Ally – even at a frequency of “6 or less” – he will still be infected but he will not become your slave. 

Dominance persists until you die (truly die, for undead), or your slave grows in power and you cannot (or choose not to) spend the points to keep him as an Ally, or the GM rules the curse is broken via supernatural means. If any of these things occur, your victim will lose Slave Mentality and become free-willed. You may use the points spent on your former Ally to dominate new victims.

This is always tied to a particular power source; e.g., 10 FP for psi powers is “ER 10 (Psi) [30].”

An ER can only power abilities of the same source. It can pay the basic FP costs to use advantages, those added by Costs Fatigue, and expenditures for extra effort and stunts (see Chapter 4). It can also fuel related skills; e.g., ER (Magical) can energize spells. Powers can still draw on normal FP; if they can’t, add -5% to the power modifier. However, an ER isn’t the same as FP. Only associated powers can deplete it. Fatigue Attacks, missed sleep, and so on don’t sap it, and other powers, wild abilities, and ordinary extra effort can’t tap it. Furthermore, depleting an ER causes none of the effects of going below 1/3 FP – and having a full ER doesn’t protect against those effects.

An ER recharges by one point every 10 minutes, independent of rest. You can recover FP at the same time if you rest. Factors that alter FP recovery generally have no effect on ER recharge rate.

Drains Familiar: Your ER draws upon the energy of your familiar. In addition to the effects of the Granted by Familiar limitation, every point of ER that you use drains 1 FP from your familiar.

        desc="You can receive and process information dramatically faster than the human norm. This improves your mental speed – notably your reaction time – but not how fast you physically move once you react. This has several game benefits. 

First, Enhanced Time Sense (ETS) includes Combat Reflexes (p. 43), and provides all the benefits of that advantage. You cannot buy Combat Reflexes if you have ETS; the two advantages are not cumulative. 

In combat, you automatically act before those without ETS, regardless of Basic Speed. If more than one combatant has ETS, they act in order of Basic Speed, and they all get to act before those who lack ETS. 

You can perceive things that happen too fast for most people to discern. For example, you cannot be fooled by a projected image, because you can see the individual frames of the film. If secret information is being sent as a high-speed “burst,” you can detect it if you’re monitoring the transmission (you cannot necessarily decipher it, but you know it’s there). At the GM’s discretion, you get a Sense roll to spot objects moving so fast that they are effectively invisible; for instance, bullets in flight. ETS is extremely valuable if you possess magical or psionic defenses that work at the speed of thought. 

If you have ETS, your rapid thought processes always allow you to ponder a problem thoroughly and respond in the manner you think best. You never suffer skill penalties for being mentally “rushed” – although you still need the usual amount of time to complete a physical task, and suffer the usual penalties for hasty work. The GM can almost never tell you to make up your mind right now. (But don’t abuse this privilege by taking half an hour to decide what to do in each turn in combat!) 

The exception is when something happens so fast that most people can’t perceive it at all. In that case, the GM is justified in asking you for an immediate response, since those without ETS get no response. 

ETS does not “slow down” the world from your viewpoint. You can still enjoy a movie by simply ignoring the frames, much as a literate person can choose whether or not to notice the individual letters in the words he’s reading. ETS also does not let you violate the laws of physics. Some things (e.g., laser beams) simply travel too fast for you to react."

        desc="In GURPS, a limb with which you can manipulate objects is an arm, regardless of where it grows or what it looks like. A normal arm can strike a blow that inflicts thrust-1 crushing damage based on ST. The human norm is two arms for 0 points. Extra arms have a base cost of 10 points apiece. 
		
Coordination: You can use extra arms freely for multiple noncombat tasks. For instance, with three arms, you could perform a one-handed task (e.g., use a computer mouse) and a two-handed task (e.g., type) simultaneously. You need Enhanced Tracking (p. 53) to perform tasks that require attention to events in more than one place at a time, however. 

You can also use all of your arms in concert for a single combat maneuver where extra arms would be helpful; e.g., grappling in close combat. And if you have at least three arms, you can use a shield normally with one arm and still wield a two-handed weapon, just as a normal human fighter can use a shield and one-handed weapon at the same time. 

No matter how many arms you have, though, you do not get additional attacks (or other extra maneuvers) in combat unless you buy Extra Attacks (see below). 

Close Combat With Extra Arms: Extra arms give a huge advantage in close combat. You cannot punch with more than one arm at a time unless you have Extra Attack, but you may grapple with all of your arms at once. Each extra arm of regular length or longer, over and above the generic set of two, gives +2 to any attempt to grapple or break free from a grapple. Having more arms than your opponent also gives +3 on any attempt to pin or resist a pin. 

Modifying Beings With One or Two Arms: Beings with one or two arms can use the special modifiers above. Point cost is equal to 1/10 the percentile modifier per affected arm. Thus, enhancements become advantages and limitations become disadvantages. For instance, Short is -50%, so it is worth -5 points per arm. Someone with two short arms would have a -10-point disadvantage. 

Those with one arm can only apply these modifiers once, but also get the -20 points for One Arm (p. 147). For instance, an elephant’s trunk would be Extra-Flexible (+50%), Long (+100%), and Weak (-50%). These modifiers total +100%, for a 10-point advantage. The -20 points for One Arm would make the net cost -10 points."

This is a Temporary Disadvantage limitation, the disadvantage being Legless (p. 141). This kind of arm is usually – but not always – Short (see below). -30%. 

No Physical Attack: The limb can manipulate but cannot punch or wield melee weapons, and gives no bonus in close combat. It can still wield a firearm or similar ranged weapon. -50%. 

Short: The arm has reach “C” (close combat only), and lacks the leverage to use any weapon that must be swung. Subtract one yard from the reach of any melee weapon wielded by that limb. If all of your arms are short, you are at -2 on any attempt to grapple. -50%. 

Weak: The arm has less than your full body ST for lifting, striking, and grappling. -25% if the arm has half your body ST, or -50% if it has 1/4 your body ST (round down in both cases). 

Weapon Mount: Instead of an arm, you have a “hardpoint” where you can mount a weapon. This may be biological, mechanical, or a hybrid of the two, depending on whether you are a living being, a machine, or a cyborg. You cannot use this mount for any purpose other than bearing a weapon. This limitation is incompatible with Feet Manipulator, No Physical Attack, Short, and Weak. -80%."

Long: Your arm is longer in proportion to your body than a human arm relative to the human body. This increases your effective SM for the purpose of calculating reach with that arm (see Size Modifier and Reach, p. 402). This does affect the reach of melee weapons wielded in that hand. Each +1 to SM also adds +1 per die to swinging damage. +100% per +1 to SM."

The GM’s word on what constitutes an “attack” is final.

A normal human can purchase one Extra Attack. This lets him attack with both hands at once, and represents unusually good coordination. Supers and nonhumans have no such limitation. A super-powered cop could buy two Extra Attacks, enabling him to shoot rays from his eyes, fire his pistol, and swing his nightstick all at once. A dragon might take four Extra Attacks and attack five times with any combination of his four clawed limbs, teeth, horns, tail, and fiery breath! 

Extra Attack is exactly that: an extra Attack maneuver on your turn in combat. It does not eliminate the -4 penalty for an “off” hand (see Ambidexterity, p. 39) or let you take multiple Aim maneuvers (see Enhanced Tracking, p. 53). You may use some of your attacks for Feint maneuvers, but you many not take multiple actions of other kinds – that requires Altered Time Rate (p. 38). 

Extra Attacks and All-Out Attack: When an individual with Extra Attacks makes an All-Out Attack, he must select one type of bonus for all his attacks that turn. He could not, for instance, take All-Out Attack (Determined) with one attack and All-Out Attack (Strong) with another. If he chooses All-Out Attack (Double) to increase his number of attacks, he gets one additional attack. 

Extra Attacks and Rapid Strike: You may use one of your melee attacks to make a Rapid Strike (see p. 370) on your turn, at the usual penalty. Your remaining attacks are in addition to this Rapid Strike, and receive no penalty. You may not use Rapid Strike with two or more attacks in one turn."

You cannot fly in a trace atmosphere or vacuum. 

Your flight Move is Basic Speed * 2 (drop all fractions). As explained in Move in Other Environments (p. 18), you can adjust this for ±2 points per ±1 yard/second. For very high speeds, take Enhanced Move (Air). If you do not have any of the Controlled Gliding, Gliding, Lighter Than Air, Small Wings, Space Flight Only, or Winged Flight limitations, you can also “fly” at half-speed underwater. Flight includes the ability to hover at Move 0 as well. 

Flight does not confer the ability to do complex acrobatics and tight turns; for that, buy Aerobatics skill (p. 174). Flight skill (p. 195) improves endurance. You can alter most of the above assumptions through special modifiers."
        Sp_lim="Cannot Hover: You must always move at least 1/4 your top airspeed (round up) when flying. This is incompatible with Controlled Gliding and Gliding. -15%. 

Controlled Gliding: Like Gliding (below) in most respects, but you can gain altitude by riding updrafts or “thermals.” A typical ascent rate is one yard per second. You can locate thermals, if any are present, on a successful IQ or Meteorology roll (one attempt per minute). -45%.

Gliding: You cannot gain altitude. With a running leap, you can launch yourself with an air Move equal to Basic Move. Each turn, you can change velocity by up to 10 yards/second * local gravity in Gs (Earth’s gravity is 1G). To accelerate, you must descend by 1 yard for each 1 yard/second added to velocity; top speed is Basic Move * 4 (but you can go faster if towed). To decelerate, you must fly level. If you do not descend at least 1 yard, you automatically decelerate by 1 yard/second that turn. When working out turning radius, your basic air Move is 10 * local gravity in Gs. Each level of Enhanced Move (Air) either doubles top speed or halves deceleration in level flight (e.g., one level means you only lose 0.5 yard/second in level flight); specify which when you buy it. -50%. 

Lighter Than Air: You fly by becoming lighter than air (or gaseous). A wind moves you 1 yard/second, in the direction it is blowing, per 5 mph of wind speed. If the wind happens to be blowing in the direction you wish to travel, this adds to your Move; otherwise, your Move goes down as you fight against the breeze. -10%. 

Low Ceiling: You cannot fly very high. This does not limit speed in any way, but the GM may require Aerobatics rolls to dodge obstacles near the ground. A 30-foot ceiling is -10%; a 10-foot ceiling is -20%; and a 5-foot ceiling is -25%. 

Small Wings: As Winged (below), except that your wingspan is no more than half your height. You use your wings to steer and to stabilize your flight – not to lift. If your wings are crippled in flight, roll against Aerobatics skill (or default) to land safely. -10%. 

Space Flight Only: You can only take this in conjunction with Space Flight or Newtonian Space Flight. You can fly only in space; you have air Move 0 in atmosphere. You require a boost to reach space from any planet with an atmosphere, and are incapable of atmospheric reentry. -75%. 

Winged: You use large wings or skin flaps to fly. Wingspan is at least twice your height. In order to take off, land, or maneuver, you must have an open area with a radius equal to your wingspan in all directions. If your wings are bound, or if a wing is crippled (more than 1/3 of your wings, if you have more than two), you cannot fly. Treat wings as arms for the purpose of targeting and crippling. If you wish to strike blows or manipulate objects with your wings, you must pay for them as Strikers or Extra Arms in addition to the cost of Flight. -25%.

Planetary: Your Flight works by “pushing off” against a planet’s gravitational or magnetic field. It’s useless in the absence of a planet. This is incompatible with all types of Space Flight. -5%.

Requires Surface: You fly by “pushing off” of surfaces. You can stay airborne for at most five seconds. After that, you must push off again by moving close enough to a rigid surface (wall, bamboo cane, etc.) – or any surface, even water, in a cinematic game – to touch it with part of your body. This doesn’t require a maneuver. Otherwise, you start to fall! -20%.

Slow: Your base flight Move is less than your Basic Speed x 2. For -25%, it equals your Basic Speed; for -45%, it is Move 1."
        Sp_enh="Newtonian Space Flight: As Space Flight (below), except that your space Move – or your space top speed, if you have Enhanced Move (Space) – is actually your “delta-v”: the total velocity change you can manage in space before running out of reaction mass.

Once you have made velocity changes equal to your delta-v, you must refuel before you can change your velocity in space again. +25%. 
        
Space Flight: You can fly in space or a vacuum (such as on the moon). Your space Move is Basic Speed * 2. If you want to be able to accelerate constantly to reach a higher top speed, like a rocket, buy Enhanced Move (Space) (p. 52). This will let you accelerate or decelerate each turn by an amount equal to your space Move, up to your enhanced top speed. For a “realistic” space move that lets you accelerate indefinitely in a vacuum (up to the speed of light), you’ll want Enhanced Move 25-27 (Space).

It does not even “enter play” until you take it out; thus, it cannot be damaged, lost, stolen, or found in a search. 

A Gizmo must be small enough to fit in an ordinary coat pocket, and must meet one of three criteria:
 
1. An item you own but did not specifically state you were carrying. For instance, if you own a handgun, and get ambushed while driving to church, you could pull out your pistol – even if the police searched your vehicle five minutes ago and found no weapons! 

2. An item that you probably own, and that is in keeping with your character concept, but that is minor or ignorable enough to leave unspecified. For instance, a policeman might happen to be carrying a spare handcuff key, while a wizard might have some eye of newt. The GM has the final say, but should be lenient if the item you wish to have is consistent with your character story. 

3. An inexpensive device widely available at your tech level. For instance, if you need to light the fuse on some dynamite, you could pull out a box of matches – and they would work, even if you just took an involuntary swim in the creek. 

Each Gizmo you can use per game session (maximum of three) costs 5 points. Note that this ability is not realistic! The GM may wish to limit it further, or forbid it, in a realistic campaign. 

Gadgeteers and Gizmos: Those with the Gadgeteer advantage (p. 56) have more latitude. In addition to the usual items available, a Gadgeteer may specify that his Gizmo is one of his inventions (which must still be small). Instead of pulling an existing gadget “out of his pocket,” a Gadgeteer can use his Gizmo to let him build what he needs on the spot. He must still possess or find the appropriate materials, and know any required skills. The GM should roll secretly against the relevant skill, at -2 or worse. A failed roll means the device doesn’t work (this still “uses up” the Gizmo). A critical failure means the device backfires spectacularly!"

Increases in SM affect your arm and leg length when calculating reach and determining whether you can negotiate obstacles; see Size Modifier and Reach (p. 402).

If you attempt to grow in a room, vehicle, container, etc. that isn’t large enough to hold you, your growth normally stops. However, if maximum thrust damage for your current ST is greater than the wall or ceiling’s DR, you burst through it. This takes one second per point of DR.

You can use Healing in two ways: 

Heal Injuries: On a success, you can heal any number of HP. This costs you 1 FP per 2 HP healed (round up). Failure costs 1d FP, but you can try again; critical failure also causes the recipient 1d damage. Even 1 HP of healing will stop bleeding. By rolling at -6, you can repair a crippled but whole limb if you completely heal the HP lost to the crippling injury. For instance, to heal a hand crippled by 4 points of damage, make an IQ-6 roll and spend 2 FP. Each healer gets only one attempt per crippled limb. Healing cannot restore lost limbs or bring back the dead. 

Cure Disease: This requires an IQ roll at a modifier determined by the GM – from +1 for the common cold to -15 for AIDS. The FP cost is equal to twice the penalty, minimum 1 FP. For instance, it would cost 6 FP to cure a disease that calls for an IQ-3 roll. 

If used more than once per day on a given subject, apply a cumulative -3 per successful healing of the same type (injury or disease) on that subject. This penalty accumulates until a full day has passed since the most recent healing. 

Healing works on your own race and on all “similar” races. In a fantasy campaign, for instance, all warm-blooded humanoid races (elves, dwarves, orcs, halflings, etc.) would be “similar.”"

Injuries Only: You can only heal injuries. -20%.

Psychic Healing: Your ability is part of the Psychic Healing psi power (see p. 256). -10%.

Affliction Only: You can only neutralize Afflictions, as described for Cure Affliction; you can’t heal injury or cure disease. -40%.

Capped: You can spend only a limited number of FP per use. This limits the severity of the diseases you can cure, requires multiple uses to heal serious injuries, and may prevent you from repairing crippled limbs. -25% for 2 FP; -20% for 4 FP; -15% for 6 FP; -10% for 8 FP; -5% for 10 FP.

Empathic: When you heal others, you take on the injuries, diseases, and Afflictions you remove instead of paying FP. These affect you even if you have specific immunities to them. They get better at the usual “natural” rate. Incompatible with Capped. -50%."

However, you (and possibly your subject) must behave in a manner consistent with the interests and moral codes of your supernatural allies, or this ability will not work. You may not combine Faith Healing with Own Race Only or Xenohealing. +20%. 

Xenohealing: You can heal beings quite dissimilar from yourself. Examples, assuming you are human: All Mammals, +20%; All Earthly Life, +40%; All Carbon-Based Life, +60%; Anything Alive, +80%; Anything Animate (including undead, golems, etc.), +100%.

Affects Self: You can also heal yourself, provided you’re conscious. Shock penalties apply to any Healing roll made on the turn after you’re wounded. +50%.

Cure Affliction: You can neutralize ongoing Afflictions – including the Affliction-like effects of Side Effect and Symptoms. Requires an IQ roll at -1 per full +50% the target effect is worth as an enhancement. FP cost is twice the penalty, min 1 FP. +60%.

You can also disregard Bulk in close combat (see Weapons for Close Combat, p. B391). You never get an Acc bonus there but you do shoot at full skill. This makes the Close Combat technique (p. 69) redundant for you.

You can use Quick-Shooting Bows (pp. 119-120) to improve your rate of fire when you Move and Attack as well as when you Attack or All-Out Attack.

        desc="You can create lifelike illusions. By default, these are constructs of light and sound that appear in a two-yard radius around you. You can always specify a smaller area; e.g., to create an illusionary gun in your hand. Illusions lack mass and substance, and can’t affect material objects in any way besides hiding or illuminating them.

To activate your ability, take a Concentrate maneuver. This requires no special die roll. You can create animated, three-dimensional images of anything you can visualize – in any spectrum you can see – synchronized with sounds in the frequency range audible to you. These persist for as long as you concentrate.

Illusions serve mainly to deceive and distract. Roll a Quick Contest of IQ against the Perception of anyone in a position to notice your illusion. To save time, the GM can roll just once for hordes of foes with the same Per. If you win, the illusion seems real to that individual. The GM decides how he reacts. He might attack an illusionary monster, try to sit on an illusionary chair, and so on. Otherwise, he spots a flaw and realizes that the illusion isn’t real (although he might not know it’s an illusion).

Illusion sometimes requires a skill roll instead of an IQ roll. In particular, to make an illusion disturbing enough to cause a Fright Check, you must win a Quick Contest of Artist (Illusion) skill against the higher of IQ or Perception for each victim. To trick someone into believing in an illusion of someone he knows, roll the lower of your Acting or Artist (Illusion) skill against the higher of your target’s IQ or Perception.

Roll a new Quick Contest when someone you’ve already fooled suddenly changes how he’s interacting with the illusion; e.g., he attacks a monster or falls through a chair that isn’t there. If he wins or ties, you don’t simulate a believable response to his action (such as the monster dodging or the chair slipping) and he catches on.

Modifiers: Your victim gets +4 if someone who knows about the illusion warns him, or if you critically fail in a Quick Contest against someone else. He gets +10 if you create the illusion unsubtly and in plain sight, or if he examines the illusion with a sense you can’t deceive – most often touch. At the GM’s option, inappropriate illusions (e.g., a pack of rabid wolves in a submarine) give a further +1 to +10, while believable ones (e.g., you pull out an illusionary gun) give from -1 to -5. If the final modifier is a net bonus, halve it if the victim is aware of superhuman powers but not the details of your powers . . . for all he knows, you can summon rabid wolves!

You can easily create babbling crowds and menacing hordes, but it’s harder to animate a convincing semblance of an illusionary person for direct, personal interaction (dueling, conversation, etc.). Multiple fake people are progressively more robotic and unresponsive; anyone rolling a Quick Contest to spot the illusion is at +4 per construct after the first.

Believable or not, illusions obstruct vision as effectively as the real thing. They don’t block weapons, though. Foes aware of your location can simply shoot through your “cover” . . . and nothing prevents unbelieving opponents from walking through your illusions to reach you."

Hallucinations: You have no real control over what the subject sees. Instead, treat the subject as hallucinating (p. B429) while you have his mind hijacked. -50%."
        Sp_enh="Special Enhancements: Add Area Effect (+50%/level) to increase radius and Ranged (+40%) to project illusions at a distance. Many illusionists also have Telekinesis (p. 82), and add a Link (p. B106) to give the impression that their illusions can interact with the material world – a convincing combination good for +4 in the Quick Contest. Additional options include:

Extended: You can fool other senses. Extending the visual or auditory range beyond your own costs +1% per point the affected hearing and vision advantages are worth; e.g., +10% to deceive Infravision. Totally new senses (Radar, taste/smell, touch, Vibration Sense, etc.) cost +20% apiece. Extended, Touch creates the sensation of substance, but the illusion still can’t affect the material world; for that, link Illusion to Telekinesis.

Independence: You don’t need to concentrate to maintain your illusions. Once you’ve created them, you can hand off control to your subconscious. Independent illusions can respond in simple ways, but can’t change unless you concentrate. For instance, an illusionary pistol would make a menacing “click” as you cocked it, and illusionary wolves would shy from a torch or snarl if someone came close, but to turn the gun into a sword or the wolves into tigers would require concentration. In particular, illusionary people can’t converse unless you actually concentrate. +40%.

Initiative: This improved form of Independence provides all the benefits of that enhancement (don’t take both) and gives illusionary people the semblance of free will. They can converse and move freely within your area of effect as if they had your DX, IQ, and skills. This requires no concentration. Treat these phantasms as insubstantial NPCs who are completely loyal to you, except that they don’t have thoughts and can’t carry out tasks for you – they simply react to their environment. +100%.

Mental: Instead of creating images that everyone can see, you project illusions into the mind of a specific target. You can affect anyone you can touch or see; the Ranged enhancement is unnecessary. Take a Concentrate maneuver and roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. the victim’s Will. You’re at -1 per person already affected. If you win, you seize control of his perceptions and can feed him artificial sensory impressions, including subtle edits (e.g., making a $5 bill look like a $100 bill), total fabrications (e.g., he’s standing on Mars without a spacesuit), and complete sensory deprivation (unless you have Auditory Only or Visual Only). These illusions never cause physical harm. Area of effect is irrelevant – it’s all in his head. You don’t control your victim’s thoughts, however. If he decides that what he’s experiencing makes no sense, he can order his body to act on the last set of impressions he felt were reliable. If he can’t see the real world, he acts at -10 – but he can still act. +100%.

Stigmata: Only available in conjunction with Mental. Your illusions are so realistic that they cause the subject to experience harmful stress or shock. To use Stigmata, you must first successfully inflict mental illusions upon your victim. Then roll a Quick Contest of IQ vs. his Will once per second. If you win, you inflict actual injury equal to your margin of victory. Specify whatever damaging effect you like – shot, eaten by tigers, fried at ground zero of a nuclear blast, etc. Suitable wounds appear on your victim’s body. Those nearby can see the wounds but not their cause; as far as they can tell, the victim is experiencing a stroke, heart attack, or similar distress. Should your victim fall unconscious for any reason (including the injury caused by this ability), you can no longer harm him. +100%."

You can learn Imbuement Skills that grant additional capabilities to weapons ready in your hands – including your hands themselves, claws, and so on. Each level of Imbue (maximum three) gives access to more and increasingly powerful Imbuement Skills. The prerequisite level of Imbue for each skill is noted with that skill."
        Sp_lim="Limited Skill Access: Your Imbue only enables you to acquire some Imbuement Skills (each of which you can still buy for multiple weapon skills). The limitation is -80% for a single skill, -60% for two, -40% for three, or -20% for four skills. Access to five or more Imbuement Skills isn’t a meaningful limitation. The GM may require PCs who want two to four skills to select thematically related choices – e.g., Burning Strike and Incendiary Weapon – rather than cherry-pick favorites. This limitation doesn’t waive Imbue level prerequisites and always applies to the whole advantage; to get Limited Skill Access for skills that require Imbue 2 or 3, buy Imbue 2 or 3, respectively, and apply this limitation to the entire advantage (even if only one of your chosen skills is at the highest level!).

Limited Skill Access: Limited Skill Access (Power-Ups 1, p. 4) may apply to an entire category of skills. Examples: Defensive Only, Enhancement Only, or Transformation Only, -10%; Armor Only or Shield Only, -20%. 

Limited Skill Application: You may only learn Imbuement Skills for one or more specific combat or weapon skills. If a particular imbuement can’t be applied to your chosen weapon(s) – such as a Ranged-Only Imbuement Skill when you’re limited to melee weapons – you can’t learn it at all. Defensive Imbuements that apply to Active Defenses can be learned for melee skills, and used with a Parry. Examples: Melee Skills Only or Ranged Skills Only, -10%; any four skills, -20%; three skills, -30%; two skills, -40%; one skill or Unarmed Only, -50%."
        Sp_enh="Unmodified Imbue is a “wild” ability that works anywhere and isn’t subject to special countermeasures, although protection effective against the type of attack that the empowered weapon delivers works normally. However, Imbue is often associated with a particular power source and subject to that source’s drawbacks; this may even be a requirement in certain game worlds. Simulate this by giving Imbue a suitable power modifier; e.g., Chi (-10%), Divine (-10%), Magical (-10%), or Psionic (-10%), all from GURPS Powers. If the power modifier is Cosmic, you only need the +50% version to bend a few limits (see individual skills) and avoid being dispelled, but you must take the +300% version if all of your Imbuement Skills can ignore DR. An upside of adding any power modifier is that the power’s Talent adds to Imbuement Skill rolls!

Imbue Other: You can use your Imbuement Skills to bolster someone else’s attacks or defenses! This requires you to Wait for your target’s action (thus forfeiting your own turn), and then roll the Imbuement Skill normally when he attacks or defends. All normal modifiers and FP costs apply; if you’re not touching him, you get an additional -1 to skill per yard that separates you, like a Regular spell. If he’s unwilling to be imbued, he can resist with Will; if he doesn’t resist (or fails to), he has no control over the effect of the imbuement. 

If you can only imbue someone else’s actions, and not your own, this modifier is +0%; if you can affect both yourself and others, it’s worth +100%. For an additional +50%, you can use normal Speed/Range penalties to skill, instead of -1 per yard."

        desc="You have fewer physiological weaknesses than ordinary living beings. The cost of this advantage depends on the precise frailties eliminated. Note that some forms of Injury Tolerance include others, and that Diffuse, Homogenous, and Unliving are mutually incompatible.

Diffuse: Your body is fluid or particulate, composed of a swarm of smaller entities, or perhaps made of pure energy. This makes you immune to crippling injuries and reduces the damage you suffer from most physical blows; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). Most foes (GM’s decision) cannot slam or grapple you! Diffuse includes all the benefits of No Blood, No Brain, and No Vitals. 100 points.

Homogenous: Your body has no vulnerable internal organs, bones, muscles, or other mechanisms. As a result, you are less susceptible to piercing and impaling attacks; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). Homogenous includes the benefits of No Brain and No Vitals. This trait is intended for entities such as iron golems, trees, and slimes. 40 points.

No Blood: You do not rely upon a vital bodily fluid (like blood) for survival. You do not bleed (see Bleeding, p. 420), are unaffected by blood-borne toxins, and are immune to attacks that rely on cutting off blood to part of your body. 5 points.

No Brain: Your brain – if you have one – is distributed throughout your body, or isn’t your true seat of consciousness. Your opponents cannot target it for extra damage. You may have a head, but a blow to the skull or eye is treated no differently than a blow to the face (except that an eye injury can still cripple that eye). 5 points.

No Eyes: You lack eyes or other vulnerable optics, but can somehow see despite this (unless of course you suffer from Blindness, p. 124). As you have no eyes, they cannot be attacked. You are also immune to blinding attacks. 5 points.

No Head: You have no head at all. This includes the benefits of No Brain. As well, you lack “skull” and “face” hit locations, and have no need for head armor. You can still see, speak, hear, smell, taste, etc. unless you take the appropriate disadvantages. Specify how you do this (supernaturally, technologically, via organs on your torso, etc.). It is common – but not mandatory – for those with No Head to have No Neck, No Eyes, or both. 7 points.

No Neck: You have no neck. As a result, you have no “neck” hit location, and cannot be decapitated, choked, or strangled. 5 points.

No Vitals: You have no vital organs (such as a heart or engine) that attackers can target for extra damage. Treat hits to the “vitals” or “groin” as torso hits. 5 points.

Unliving: Your body is not composed of living flesh. You take reduced damage from piercing and impaling attacks, but are not quite as resilient as if you were Homogenous; see Injury to Unliving, Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets (p. 380). This trait is intended mainly for machines and corporeal undead. 20 points.

Damage Reduction: You divide the injury you suffer by 2, 3, or 4 after subtracting DR from damage and applying wounding modifiers. Unmodified, this trait reduces all injury – but except in high-powered supers games, the GM should consider requiring the Limited modifier; see Limited Defenses (p. B46). It would be fair to restrict heroes to “Common,” “Occasional,” or even “Rare” classes, or to damage types directly related to their powers. 50 points for a divisor of 2, 75 points for 3, 100 points for 4. 

Independent Body Parts: See Independent Body Parts (p. 52) for this complex form of Injury Tolerance, intended for undead and fantasy monsters. 35 points. 

Unbreakable Bones: Your bones are nearly indestructible, or you have alternative structural support that’s difficult to damage (e.g., internal force fields). Damage to limbs and extremities still causes injury, subject to the usual maximums, but the injury needed to cripple these body parts is twice normal; that is, the amount usually required to dismember. This represents damage to the covering, not the “skeleton.” Crippling is at worst lasting; you never suffer permanent crippling or dismemberment (see pp. B421-422). The GM may rule that injury that destroys your body (-10xHP) breaks your skeleton, but since you’re dead, this is a special effect. If this protection extends to your vitals and brain, add No Vitals and No Brain: your vitals and brain are in their usual locations, but your indestructible skeleton encloses them and prevents severe injury effects. 10 points."
        Sp_lim="Misty: For Diffuse only. You can become a fog or a mist. While Diffuse, you cannot affect the material world in any meaningful way. You cannot speak, attack, or even block others’ sightlines. You drift at half your normal Move. Though immune to most attacks, you’re still material; you can be affected by strong winds, powerful suction, etc. Misty includes Infiltration. -20% if you can use magic or psi in mist form; -40% if not. 

Tenuous Form: Requires Body of Swarm. You must make a conscious effort to maintain cohesion. Whenever you suffer injury or fail a HT roll, make a Will roll. Failure means your body collapses into a normal swarm of its component creatures. To reform, you must concentrate for seconds equal to the injury taken or the margin of failure on the HT roll. Additional damage to the swarm while reforming adds to the total time needed. -50%."
        Sp_enh="Infiltration: For Diffuse only. Your body is a fluid that can flow through the tiniest of holes. In addition to the usual benefits of Diffuse, you can ooze through porous barriers and narrow cracks. You can’t shapeshift, stretch abnormally, or sprout new body parts – just seep under doors, through screens, etc. +40%.

Swarm: For Diffuse only. You’re a coordinated swarm of tiny creatures. You can scatter by taking a Concentrate maneuver. Your outer perimeter travels at your best applicable Move; maximum radius is 1/2 mile (buy Area Effect to change this). While scattered, only area-effect, cone, and explosion attacks can injure you, and only in proportion to the area they blanket; e.g., an attack that covers 5% of your area does 5% normal damage. You can focus your senses on any point within your area; changing viewpoints requires a Ready maneuver. Otherwise, treat this state as Insubstantiality (p. 55). To resume your normal form, you must contract to your usual size (at your Move score) and then take a Concentrate maneuver. Swarm includes Infiltration. +80% if you can’t affect the material world; +160% if you can.

Body of Swarm: For Diffuse only. You can become a swarm (p. B461) of gnat- to rat-sized bodies. This moves at your best applicable Move; can bite, sting, etc. for thrust crushing damage for your ST; and is dispersed by injury equal to your HP. A dispersed swarm is effectively “unconscious” and unable to act in concert. A determined foe might contain and continue to damage your dispersed bodies, though. Should you reach -HP, enough of your bodies have been killed to dissociate your consciousness and kill you! +0% for rat- or bat-sized bodies; +40% for cockroach- or gnat-sized bodies with full Infiltration. 

Flying Swarm: Requires Body of Swarm. While in swarm form, your component bodies can fly. Air Move is twice Basic Speed. +30%. 

Humanoid Form: Requires Body of Swarm. You can assemble your component bodies into any vaguely manlike form, giving you a limited ability to “morph” (although you won’t pass close inspection). +50%. 

Infiltration: For Diffuse only. Your body is a fluid. It can filter or flow through the tiniest of holes. In addition to the normal benefits of Diffuse, you can ooze through porous barriers and narrow cracks and keyholes. You can’t shapeshift, stretch abnormally, or sprout new body parts – just seep under doors, or through screens, ventilation grates, clothing (2 seconds), chinks in armor (5 seconds), etc. +40%. 

Scatter: Requires Body of Swarm. You can scatter your component bodies by taking a Concentrate maneuver; your outer perimeter travels at your best applicable Move. Your constituent bodies can communicate instantly and work in a coordinated fashion over a half-mile radius (buy Area Effect to change this). While scattered, only area-effect, cone, and explosion attacks can injure you, and only in proportion to the area they blanket; e.g., an attack that covers just 5% of your area does 5% of its normal damage. You can focus your senses on any point within your area; changing viewpoints requires a Ready maneuver. Otherwise, treat this state as Insubstantiality (p. B62). +40% if you can’t affect the material world while scattered; +120% if you can.  "

        desc="You have a natural or built-in attack with which you can inflict physical damage (for nondamaging attacks, see Affliction, p. 35, and Binding, p. 40). Examples include a dragon’s fiery breath, a robot’s built-in blaster, and a god’s ability to hurl lightning bolts. 

By default, this is a ranged attack with 1/2D 10, Max 100, Acc 3, RoF 1, Shots N/A, and Recoil 1, although you can apply modifiers to change these statistics (see pp. 101-116). 

An Innate Attack inflicts 1d damage per level. Its cost per level depends on the type of damage it inflicts: 

Burning (burn): Your attack inflicts damage using flame, an energy beam, or localized electrical burns. It may ignite fires! 5 points/level. 

Corrosion (cor): Your attack involves acid, disintegration, or something similar. For every 5 points of basic damage you inflict, reduce the target’s DR by 1, in addition to regular damage. (Living beings heal natural DR at the same rate as HP.) 10 points/level. 

Crushing (cr): Your attack inflicts damage through blunt impact, like a bludgeoning weapon or an explosive blast. It is likely to cause knockback (p. 378), and is more effective at inflicting blunt trauma (p. 379) than other types of damage. 5 points/level. 

Cutting (cut): Your attack inflicts lacerations, like those caused by an axe or broken glass. Multiply penetrating damage by 1.5. Cutting attacks can inflict blunt trauma and cause knockback. 7 points/level. 

Fatigue (fat): Your attack is nonlethal. It might involve a low-amperage electric shock or a “mind blast,” or even inflict a weakening effect such as hypothermia or starvation. It reduces FP, not HP, and cannot affect machines. 10 points/level. 

Impaling (imp): Your attack inflicts stab wounds, like a spear or an arrow. Double penetrating damage in flesh! Impaling attacks can target the eyes and vital organs, can inflict blunt trauma, and may slip through high-tech flexible armor. 8 points/level. 

Piercing: Your attack involves a fast, blunt projectile, such as a bullet, or is sharp but too small to qualify as impaling, like a dart or a stinger. It may inflict blunt trauma, and can target the eyes and vital organs. There are four subclasses of piercing attack: 

Small Piercing (pi-): Use this for very low-energy projectiles (e.g., blowgun darts), or for attacks that tend to punch through the target and leave a small wound channel (e.g., armor-piercing bullets). Against flesh, halve damage that penetrates DR. 3 points/level. 

Piercing (pi): Use this for most rifle and pistol bullets. 5 points/level. 

Large Piercing (pi+): Use this for attacks similar to large-caliber solid bullets, or for smaller projectiles that create large wound channels (e.g., hollow-point bullets). Multiply penetrating damage in flesh by 1.5. 6 points/level. 

Huge Piercing (pi++): Use this for attacks that leave an even larger wound channel than large piercing. Double penetrating damage in flesh! 8 points/level. 

Toxic (tox): Your attack inflicts cellular damage, in the manner of disease, poison, or radiation. It cannot normally affect machines. The modifiers Cyclic (p. 103), Onset (p. 113), and Resistible (p. 115) are usual, but not required. 4 points/level. 

Partial Dice: You do not have to buy whole-numbered dice of damage. Each ±1 to damage counts as ±0.3 dice. Round the final cost up. For instance, an Innate Attack that does 1d+2 damage counts as 1.6 dice. If it were crushing (5 points/die), it would cost 1.6 x 5 = 8 points. Some attacks do only 1 point of damage. This counts as 0.25 dice. Once again, round cost up. Such attacks can still be deadly – especially if they involve the Follow-Up (p. 105) or Cyclic (p. 103) enhancement! 

Description: After applying all relevant modifiers, name and describe the attack. You can be as general as “dragon fire” or as specific as “9mm machine pistol cybernetically implanted in right arm.” At the GM’s discretion, the description can imply additional noncombat abilities; for instance, a jet of high-pressure water could put out fires. The GM has the final say as to whether your description fits the campaign setting, and may modify the attack if necessary."
        Sp_lim="—"
        Sp_enh="Special Modifiers: Many special modifiers for Innate Attack appear under Attack Enhancements and Limitations (p. 102). You can use these to create almost any attack – built-in guns, lasers, jets of liquid fire, gale-force winds, etc. – and to duplicate the capabilities of weapons listed in GURPS books. Fatigue and toxic attacks intended to simulate poison or disease require modifiers. Noxious agents on Claws (p. 42), Teeth (p. 91), darts, etc. use Follow-Up (p. 105). Gases and sprays use Respiratory Agent (p. 108) or Contact Agent (p. 103), often with Area Effect (p. 102), Cone (p. 103), or Jet (p. 106). Attacks that depend on touch or on skin contact use Blood Agent (p. 102) or Contact Agent, plus one of Aura (p. 102) or Melee Attack (p. 112). Regardless of other modifiers, Innate Attacks are treated as ranged attacks unless given the Melee Attack limitation; then they’re considered melee weapons."

Physical and energy attacks cannot harm you, but you’re still vulnerable to psionic and (nonmaterial) magical attacks. Likewise, your physical and energy attacks cannot affect physical opponents. Your psi abilities and magic spells can affect the physical world, but at -3 to all skill rolls. 

Although you can pass through solids, you must still breathe. When moving through a solid object, treat this as if you were swimming underwater for purposes of suffocation. You cannot materialize inside a solid object. 

Your “natural” form (physical or insubstantial) is considered a special effect. You must take this advantage if you can change between a physical and an insubstantial form.

Usually On: Similar to Always On, but you can materialize for short periods with great effort. Materialization costs 1 FP per second. -40%.

No Vertical Move: You can’t disregard gravity. You must move across a horizontal surface, or along a slope that wouldn’t require Climbing rolls. You still weigh nothing, so you don’t leave footprints and can walk on surfaces that wouldn’t support a solid body, such as the surface of a body of water. -10%.

Noisy: You aren’t silent. You make noises equivalent to footfalls when moving and breathing at all times, and are no harder to hear than an ordinary human. -5%.

Projection: Your body doesn’t become insubstantial. Instead, it falls unconscious and you step out of it in insubstantial form. Like someone using unmodified Insubstantiality, you’re visible and present, making you subject to anything that affects insubstantial entities . . . while your body remains in the physical world, vulnerable to material threats; see Projection (p. 44). You can’t use spells, psi abilities, etc. in this form unless you also take Affect Substantial. -50%.

Difficult Materialization: Materialization costs you 1 FP/minute. This lesser version of Usually On is mutually exclusive with that limitation. -20%. 

Ectoplasmic Materialization: You materialize as ectoplasm rather than as normal matter. While you can touch and affect the material world, you aren’t fully material. Your ectoplasmic body has DR 0, HP 1, regardless of your spirit stats. On the upside, it has Injury Tolerance (Homogenous, No Blood); see p. B60. -35%.

Illusory Form: When you dematerialize, you don’t become wholly intangible. Your body is made out of sensory impressions such as sights and sounds. Attacks can harm you in the same way and with the same limits as for Shadow Form (p. B83): half damage for physical attacks, full damage for energy attacks, and damage increased 50% for light attacks. -15%."

You cannot materialize these objects inside other objects or characters. No encumbrance is +10%; Light, +20%; Medium, +50%; Heavy, +100%. 

Partial Change: You can turn part of your body substantial while other parts remain insubstantial, or vice versa. Thus, you could reach through a wall and tap someone on the shoulder. If you also have Can Carry Objects, you can materialize your hand, pick up material objects, and carry them while insubstantial. +20%, or +100% if you can turn an item you are carrying substantial without dropping it (this requires turning your hand substantial, too).

Ghost Air: You still have to breathe while insubstantial, but it’s not the air of the real world. Treat the insubstantial “plane” as having its own air supply. Thus, other insubstantial entities can still choke you, you can be affected by attacks with Affects Insubstantial and Respiratory, etc., but you can walk through solid matter without worrying about holding your breath. +10%. 

Substantial Communication: This is a weaker version of Affects Substantial (+100%). You can use any of your mental abilities (psi, magic, etc.) to communicate with the real world. They take the standard -3 to skill unless they have the Affects Substantial (+40%) modifier. This includes abilities that generate sound or light (but not enough to blind, daze, stun, etc.), and those that allow you to project your thoughts or read thoughts. No other abilities will cross over, regardless of their enhancements. +40%.

Reversion: Pick one form, substantial or insubstantial, as “native.” (Unless otherwise specified, a spirit’s native form is insubstantial.) While in the other form, you cannot be killed by perils incapable of injuring your native form; e.g., physical weapons, if natively immaterial. If such injury would reduce you to 0 or fewer HP, you go to 0 HP and revert to your native form, where you must remain until fully healed. Reversion isn’t effective against things that can harm your native form – specially designed weapons, your own Vulnerabilities, etc. – which can take you below 0 HP. +60%.

        desc="You can travel through time or to parallel worlds (sometimes known as “timelines”) merely by willing the “jump.” Decide whether you are a time-jumper or a world-jumper. To do both, you must buy Jumper (Time) and Jumper (World) separately, at full cost. 

To initiate a jump, you must visualize your destination, concentrate for 10 seconds, and make an IQ roll. You may hurry the jump, but your roll will be at -1 per second of concentration omitted (-10 to jump with no preparation at all). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination, which can be any time or world the GM wishes! 

You appear at your destination at exactly the same place you left your previous time or world – or as close as possible. When jumping through time, this means the same place at a different time. When jumping between worlds, this means the same place at the same time, but on a parallel world. 

If there is no corresponding “safe” location within 100 yards of your destination – for instance, if you jump while on an airplane to a destination with no plane at your location, or from a half-mile deep mine to a destination with no corresponding mine – the jump will fail and you will know why it failed. This does not prevent you from jumping into other types of danger, such as radiation, gunfire, or wild animals. If you have Danger Sense, the GM should roll before you make a hazardous jump; on a success, you get a warning. 

This ability always costs at least 1 FP to use, whether it succeeds or fails. Particularly “distant” times or worlds might cost more, perhaps up to 10 FP, at the GM’s discretion. If you are a machine, this ability does not cost you FP – but if you have passengers, each of them must pay the FP cost. 

For an example of how Jumper might work in a particular game world, see World-Jumpers (p. 544). 

Carrying Things: You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (see p. 74). Take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below) if you wish to carry more weight, or bring along other people. 

However, if multiple Jumpers of the same kind are in physical contact, when one jumps, the others can “hitch a ride” if they wish – even if the Jumper who initiates the jump does not want company. Only the person initiating the jump makes a die roll; wherever he ends up, the others do, too. 

If you are a world-jumper, “hitching a ride” is the only way to visit a new parallel world (save for a critical failure!). However, once you reach a world, you can memorize its “feel” by concentrating and spending character points to “learn” that world as an IQ/Easy skill. This takes one hour per point you wish to spend. Use this skill in place of IQ when you travel to that world in the future. You never have to memorize a world, but if you do not, you roll at IQ-3 to attempt to return. 

Time-jumpers have no similar restriction. 

You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. GMs who do not want the PCs jumping multiple times per adventure are free to impose mandatory limitations (e.g., Limited Use) that cannot be bought off."

Limited Jump: You can only travel a certain distance through time, or a certain number of “removes” between parallel worlds, per jump. -10%. 

Limited Access: For Jumper (World) or (Spirit). You can only jump between two particular worlds – Earth and Faërie, the material world and Hell, the waking world and Dreamland, etc. The size of this limitation depends on how many additional worlds exist in the setting. If there’s only one, it’s meaningless (-0%). If there are many, it might be worth -20% or more, at the GM’s discretion. 

Maximum Range: You can only jump a certain total distance through time, or a certain number of “removes” between parallel worlds, no matter how many hops you make. 

Naked: You can carry nothing when you jump! You always arrive naked. -30%. 

Stunning: You are always mentally stunned after a jump. -10%.

Limited Access: For Jumper (World) or (Spirit). You can only jump between two particular worlds. If there are many worlds in the setting, this is worth -20% or more (GM’s discretion).

Projection: You travel in mind, not body. Your body remains behind, unconscious and vulnerable, while you appear at your destination as an intangible projection. -50% if you can’t affect your destination at all; -0% if you can use spells, mental abilities, and Maledictions; -25% if you send a physical body but leave an unconscious one behind.

Special Movement: You need to move to use your ability. If you merely have to walk and be free of restraints, -10%. If you need to enter orbit and accelerate past the speed of light, -40%.

Special Portal: You need a particular “gateway” to use your advantage. “Any reflective surface” is -20%; a specific summoning ritual is -60%; one specific spot at a certain time of the year is -80%."

Warp Jump: Requires Warp advantage. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. +10%.

Interplanar: For Jumper (World) or (Spirit). You can enter higher planes of existence. +100% if you can reach these worlds as well as parallel/spirit worlds; +0% if you can only reach higher planes.

Reliable: Each level adds +1 to both the IQ roll to use Jumper and the automatic failure threshold. +5% per +1 (maximum +10).

        desc="Giant leeches, striges, vampires, and many other traditional and Bmovie monsters suck the life from their victims. “Psychic vampires” and evil spirits usually dispense with the traditional bite. Creepy supers sometimes even have ranged life-stealing abilities.

To use Leech, you must maintain ongoing contact with your victim; a brief touch isn’t enough. In combat, you must grapple or pin him – which is trivial if he’s unconscious or otherwise helpless. Out of combat, options include a long handshake, hug, or more intimate embrace.

While you maintain contact, each level of Leech lets you drain 1 HP per second from your victim. You heal 1 HP per full 3 HP you steal. You can’t raise your HP above normal, but you can continue the drain without healing yourself. The drain ends instantly if you release your victim, or if he breaks free or dies. If he survives, the stolen HP heal like any other injury. Leech 1 costs 25 points; successive levels cost 4 points apiece. For example, to drain 10 HP per second requires Leech 10, which costs 25 + 9 x 4 = 61 points. At the GM’s option, points of drain convert to dice as described under Modifying Dice + Adds (p. B269); e.g., 4 HP become 1d, 7 HP become 2d, and 10 HP become 2d+3.

Leech only affects living beings. It can’t steal HP from machines or inanimate objects. However, the GM may allow a variant ability – Leech (Mechanical) – that only affects machines. The point cost is identical. With Steal HT, this could represent the ability of “gremlins” to cause machines to fail and break down. Steal FP is off limits."
        Sp_lim="Leeches who must touch their victim’s skin have the Contact Agent limitation (-30%). The traditional vampire has Blood Agent (-40%), and must bite his victim; Sharp Teeth (p. B91) are indispensable. These options and the Ranged option discussed above are mutually exclusive. An additional limitation is specific to Leech:

Only Heals FP: You can’t heal HP. You can only use the HP you drain to restore missing FP, as described for Heals FP. This is incompatible with Heals FP. -20%.

Obligate Doleovore: You can only feed on pain. Your total (not bonus) HP drain is equal to half your victim’s pain penalty, as described for Doleovore. (You can take both modifiers, meaning that you can only feed on those in pain, but get “extra” HP from them.) -50%. 

Obligate Metuovore: You can only feed on fear. Your total (not bonus) HP drain is equal to your victim’s margin of failure on a Fright Check, as described for Metuovore. (You can take both modifiers, meaning that you can only feed on frightened victims, but get “extra” HP from them.) -50%."
        Sp_enh="To work at a distance, Leech requires Malediction 1 or 2 (+100% or +150%) on top of Ranged (+40%). Roll the Quick Contest of Will for Malediction every second (once per turn, in combat). Each victory lets you drain 1 HP per level. You can only affect one victim at a time. A few special enhancements are common:

Accelerated Healing: You heal 1 HP per HP stolen. Your attack doesn’t harm your victim any faster than usual, but it heals you more quickly. +25%.

Hazard: You can combine Steal FP with one of the modifiers under Hazard (p. B104) to steal dreams (Missed Sleep), warmth (Freezing), and so on. Treat the stolen FP as if they were lost to that hazard. Any FP or HP you gain can heal your losses to the same hazard.

Heals FP: Every 3 HP you drain restores 1 HP or 1 FP. You can’t raise FP above normal. +60% if you can choose whether to heal HP or FP; +30% if you only heal FP when healed to full HP.

Steal (Other Score): You steal ST, DX, IQ, HT, or FP instead of HP. ST theft reduces BL and damage. IQ drain lowers Will and Per. ST and HT losses don’t lower HP and FP, though. Attribute losses affect skills based on those scores. Drain occurs at the rate of 1 point per level of Leech. It ceases if the victim’s score reaches 0. Regardless of what you steal, you heal 1 HP (1 FP, with Heals FP or Only Heals FP) per 3 points drained. Your victim regains lost scores at the rate he recovers FP. Cost depends on what you drain: -25% for FP (or +50%, if you drain HP when your victim has 0 FP), +100% for ST or HT, or +300% for DX or IQ. If you can steal more than one of these, buy Leech several times with different enhancements. To use these simultaneously, add Link.

Steal Youth: You permanently age your victim instead of stealing HP. Each second of draining ages him by months equal to your level. See Age and Aging (p. B444) for long-term effects, and note that Unaging subjects are immune. You don’t heal, but may grow a month younger per two months stolen, if desired. This is incompatible with other special modifiers. +300% if victims regain their youth when you die; +450% if truly permanent.

Doleovore: You can drain bonus HP from people in pain. From a given subject, you may steal additional HP per second equal to half his current pain penalty – that is, an extra 1 HP/second for Moderate Pain, 2 HP/second for Severe Pain, or 3 HP/second for Terrible Pain – or an extra 4 HP/second from someone in Agony; see p. B428. Victims with Low Pain Threshold double your feeding potential; those with High Pain Threshold halve it. +20%.

Metuovore: You can take extra HP from frightened people. From a given victim, you may drain additional HP per second equal to his margin of failure on a Fright Check rolled in your presence. To drain more, find another coward or scare your victim again! +20%.

Addictive Bite: Your drain is addictive for the victim! If you steal more than 1/3 of his HP with an unbroken series of attacks, he gains the Addiction disadvantage until he can break it by withdrawal. +200%, or +400% if your victim also acquires Uncontrollable Appetite (12)."

• You have local jurisdiction, the ability to arrest suspected criminals, the power to perform searches with an appropriate warrant, and possibly the right to carry a concealed weapon. Examples: a Victorian bobby or a modern policeman. 5 points.

• You have three or more of the above abilities. Examples: a Gestapo, KGB, or Stasi agent. 15 points. 

Legal Enforcement Powers almost always require an appropriate Duty (p. 133). In some cases, a Reputation (positive, negative, or mixed) is also appropriate. All levels of Legal Enforcement Powers include Police Rank 0 (see p. 30). To become a senior law enforcer, buy more Rank.

Two levels of “police powers” exist in Dungeon Fantasy: 

Town Watchman: You’re authorized to search and arrest lawbreakers in one specific town. This doesn’t grant the right to commit crimes! It mostly means that you have a job that pays your $150/week living expenses – no dice rolls required – as long as you forgo crafting and other “town” activities that the GM feels would be full-time work. However, you can replace bumming, busking, and haranguing (Dungeon Fantasy 2, p. 4) with shaking down crooks for fines; use the same rules, but roll against the highest of Fast-Talk, Intimidation, Streetwise, or a suitable weapon skill, treating the other skills as complementary. You may carry arms and armor appropriate to Status 2 (p. 14) in service to the town. Finally, when the town has a quest to offer (Dungeon Fantasy 2, p. 4), you hear about it automatically. 5 points. 

King’s Man: You enjoy the above powers in all the towns of an entire kingdom! You can also requisition food and fodder when travelling in the realm, even when en route to private dungeon raids; thus, you can reduce the cost of rations to just what you need for the dungeon (though you must still carry the weight of the free supplies). See also Travel (Dungeon Fantasy 2, p. 5). You may carry arms and armor befitting Status 2 anywhere in the kingdom when you’re on duty. If the kingdom has a quest to offer, you learn of it automatically. Lastly, you get a snazzy surcoat ($350, 0.5 lb.) that’s blue with silver fleurs-de-lis, red with golden lions rampant, etc. 15 points."

The point cost depends on how sweeping the immunity is (GM’s judgment): 

• You are not subject to ordinary laws, but the rules that govern your behavior are just as strict. Examples: a medieval abbot or a modern UN observer. 5 points.
 
• As above, but the laws that apply to you are less strict than those that apply to most people. Example: a medieval bard (see below). 10 points.

Critical failure while shopping or selling on the black market there is treated as mere failure; failure at shoplifting, cheating, or pickpocketing results in no consequences worse than “no material gain”; and sauntering around over-armed for your Status (pp. 13-14) leads to nothing worse than being escorted home to put away the hardware. Getting caught at these crimes, or even betraying a local quest sponsor, won’t trigger the effects of Scum and Villainy (Dungeon Fantasy 2, p. 4). You still can’t debase coin safely. 5 points. 

Royal Favor: You enjoy the above privileges in all the towns of a kingdom, and may treat even critical failure at debasing coin as mere failure.

Add your Magery level to Perception when you roll to sense magic items, and to IQ when you learn Thaumatology skill (p. 225). 

Reduce the time required to learn new spells in play (but not the point cost) by 10% per Magery level, to a minimum of 60% of the usual time at Magery 4. For instance, with Magery 3, you would learn spells in 70% the usual time. 

Powerful spells require a minimum level of Magery as a prerequisite, so be sure to skim the Spell List (pp. 242-253) when deciding how much Magery you need. Note that high Magery lets you produce powerful results with even the most basic spells; see Magery and Effect (p. 237). The GM sets the maximum Magery allowed to PCs. Magery 3 is about right for “classic fantasy.” 10 points/level (on top of the 5 points for Magery 0). 

Mages in Nonmagical Settings: The use of Magery becomes tricky in nonmagical backgrounds. You still have the ability to sense magic, but until you gain experience with magic, the GM should not say, “That idol is magical,” but, “That idol looks very strange to you, very sinister. You sense there is something special about it.” 

If you are from a nonmagical culture, you do not start with any spells, but you can still learn magic if you find an opportunity. When you enter a magical world, those who can detect your aura recognize you as a potential magic-user. How they react depends on the setting. 

Magery 0 costs 5 points for all mages, but you may apply one of the limitations below to the 10 points/level for Magery 1+. Limited Magery is sometimes known as “aspected Magery.”"
        Sp_lim="Dance: You must be free to use bodily motions in order to cast spells. You are not freed from rituals requiring movement as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). However, you need not speak at all to cast your spells. -40%. 

Dark-Aspected: You can only use your powers in darkness. Regardless of the time of day or night, any light greater than candlelight or starlight deprives you of your abilities, though your aura reveals that you are a mage. -50%. 

Day-Aspected: You can use your powers only when the sun is in the sky – on average, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. During solar eclipses, you have no powers! The effects of other astronomical events are up to the GM. When the sun is down, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun’s position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%. 

Musical: You must use a musical instrument in order to cast spells. You can never cast spells silently. -50%. 

Night-Aspected: You can only use your powers when the sun is not in the sky – on average, from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. When the sun is up, you have none of your magical abilities, although a look at your aura reveals that you are a mage. You are not affected by being in buildings, underground, and so on; only the sun’s position matters. You know automatically (if you are awake) when it is one minute to sunrise and one minute to sunset. -40%. 

One College Only: Your Magery only benefits the spells of a single college and the Recover Energy spell (p. 248). You learn other spells as though you were a nonmage, and can only cast them in high-mana areas. You may still count such spells as prerequisites for spells in your own college. You cannot detect magic items unless they contain at least one spell of your college, in which case you roll normally for detection on first sight and first touch. -40%. 

Solitary: Your magical abilities are at -3 for every sapient being within five yards of you, and -6 for anyone touching you. As partial compensation, you get a roll vs. IQ to notice any time a sapient creature enters or leaves the five-yard area around you – but this only works on a single person. If there is already someone standing next to you, you won’t notice if someone else approaches. -40%. 

Song: You must be able to sing in order to cast your spells. You are not freed from the ritual of speaking to cast spells as your spell level increases (see Magic Rituals, p. 237). -40%.

Ceremonial Magery: You don’t have the option of quick casting. Casting spells must always be ceremonial. This takes 10 times as long as normal and has all the other benefits and restrictions of ceremonial magic. -40%. Ceremonial Magery often combines with Solitary Ceremonial Casting (p. 130) for a net -30% limitation. 

Divided Magery: Instead of a single total amount of Fatigue applicable to all spells, you have a separate amount of Fatigue for each college. The sum of these amounts is your total Fatigue. You can only spend each college’s Fatigue on its own spells. Your level of Magery is taken into account in determining your skill in spells from any college in which you have assigned Fatigue points; it does not affect your skill with spells in other colleges, except that it always applies to Recover Energy. If you expend Fatigue on nonmagical actions, you can choose which college’s Fatigue to spend. When you regain Fatigue, you can choose which college’s Fatigue comes back first. -40%. 

Hyperdivided Magery works the same way, but has Fatigue points assigned to single spells instead of single colleges. -80%. 

Impermanent Magery: Some treatments of magic define it as incapable of permanently changing the material world (see Glamour, p. 20). This doesn’t put any spells off limits. Instead, spells that would normally cause a permanent change fail to do so. They don’t have to be maintained, but the subject continues to register as magical as long as the spell is in effect, the spell can be dispelled, and any benefits it grants are manadependent. This is ordinarily a -10% limitation. If some nonmagical means of dispelling the effects is available, such as prayer or the touch of iron, it becomes a -20% limitation. For more details, see Faerie Glamour (p. 168). 

One-College Magery: In a setting with a different system of magical colleges, paths, or the like (see Alternate Colleges, p. 160), OneCollege Magery may need a different value as a limitation. The fewer colleges, the less restrictive it is. Appropriate limitations are -10% for two colleges, -20% for three to six, -30% for seven to 14, -40% for 15 to 30, or -60% for more than 30. 

One-Spell Magery: A more drastic restriction than OneCollege Magery. Your Magery applies only to a single spell. This can be generalized to Hyperdivided Magery, with fatigue pools assigned to single spells instead of single colleges. -80%. To create a mage who knows a few specific spells (see Fixed Magic, p. 161, for one example), reduce the limitation by 5% per spell after the first. For example, a mage with Three-Spell Magery would have a -70% limitation.

Restructurable Magery: Restructurable Magery is a further extension of Divided Magery; it permits the reassignment of Fatigue capacity among colleges. This requires an extended period of concentration, long enough to be impractical in a hand-to-hand fight. The value of the limitation depends on how long the reassignment takes: -8% for 1-minute reassignment, -12% for 10-minute reassignment, -20% for 1- hour reassignment, and -24% for 8- hour reassignment. 

For Hyperdivided Magery, the limitations are -16% for 1-minute reassignment, -24% for 10-minute reassignment, -40% for 1-hour reassignment, and -48% for 8-hour reassignment. This form of Restructurable Magery can help create a mage who starts out an adventure by reading specific spells, and then can cast those spells until he exhausts each spell’s Fatigue pool."
        Sp_enh="Solitary Ceremonial Casting: Normally, ceremonial spellcasting requires at least two participants. (Enchantment is an exception; it can be done alone.) This advantage permits a mage to cast spells ceremonially by himself. +10%."

		desc="You are less likely to be affected by magic. Subtract your Magic Resistance from the skill of anyone casting a spell on you, and add it to your roll to resist any spell that offers a resistance roll. For instance, if you have Magic Resistance 3, wizards have -3 to cast spells on you and you get +3 to resist. In addition, you may roll against HT + Magic Resistance to resist the effects of magical elixirs. You cannot “turn off” this advantage to let friendly wizards cast spells on you (e.g., to heal you) or to benefit from helpful elixirs! 

Magic Resistance only interferes with spells cast directly on you. It provides no benefit against Missile spells (which are cast on the wizard’s hand and hurled at you), attacks by magic weapons, or information-gathering spells that aren’t cast directly on you. It also has no effect on supernatural powers other than magic; e.g., divine miracles, psionics, or the innate powers of spirits. 

Magic Resistance, and its precise level, can be recognized by any mage who looks at your aura, or by anyone who casts a spell on you. You cannot combine Magic Resistance with Magery. If you have even one level of Magic Resistance, you can’t cast spells at all (although you can still use magic weapons)."

The caster still gets a penalty equal to your MR. If the spell fails for whatever reason, you gain a number of character points equal to the spell’s modified Fatigue Point cost to cast (e.g., reduced by high skill). You can these points to improve traits (anything but skills) temporarily or heal yourself. This functions exactly like Absorption for Damage Resistance (p. B46). +50%. 

Potent Resistance: Your Magic Resistance is especially powerful. In addition to providing its normal benefits, it also provides a “passive-aggressive” defense that resists up to three effects that normal Magic Resistance doesn’t: Missile spells are affected by your Magic Resistance if they are aimed in the hex you’re in; magical weapons are affected (e.g., if a sword enchanted with +1 Puissance hits you, you would subtract your MR from the item’s Endurance; if it reduced it to below 15, then that item wouldn’t gain bonus damage); or information-gathering spells targeting something in your possession. +50% for one, +100% for two, +150% for all three."

This is most effective against Mental Blow, Mental Stab, Sleep, and Psychic Vampirism abilities, but it will typically cause at least one second of mental stun (after which roll Will every second to snap out of it) for anything more aggressive than Telereceive. +100%."

        desc="You have a pool of character points that you can reallocate under certain conditions. You may rearrange these points to add a skill (spell, technique, etc.) or mental advantage temporarily – or to improve such a trait, if you already have it. When you do, you lose any abilities to which those points were previously assigned. 

This advantage comes in “slots.” A slot can hold one skill or mental advantage at a time. Each slot has a fixed base cost, plus a cost per point in the pool for that slot. Both costs depend on the type of Modular Abilities you have. 

Computer Brain: Your abilities are actually computer programs. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities. 

Chip Slots: As above, but the programs come on physical chips. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. 

Super-Memorization: You gain new abilities through rapid study. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. 

Cosmic Power: You simply wish new abilities into being. Unlike other Modular Abilities, you only ever have one “slot.” 10 points per point of abilities.

Divine Inspiration: Your abilities are minor wishes granted by a Higher Power. Reallocating points requires at least a second of prayer per character point. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities.

Slotted Cosmic Power: Like regular Cosmic Power, you simply wish new abilities into being. However, this Modular Ability comes in “slots,” and you can only assign one trait to a slot. This takes one second. Due to the pricing structure, a 1- point slot should be bought as normal Cosmic Power instead. Cost per slot: 7 points base + 5 points per point of abilities.

Telepathic Learning: You can “tap into” the minds of people nearby and borrow their knowledge. The points in each slot can be used only to add skills and learnable advantages (such as languages); this takes seconds equal to the number of character points being added. The catch is that someone within one mile must know the trait that you’re adding (GM’s call) – and you cannot add more points than he has in the trait. If the distance between you and the nearest “donor” becomes more than a mile, you lose the trait! Cost per slot: 5 points base + 4 points per point of abilities.

Spirit Trapping: You have the ability to carry one or more spirits about with you, and to access certain of their abilities. If a spirit knows a spell, you can tap its knowledge to cast the spell. If it has purely factual knowledge, you can treat it as a reference work, gaining some number of added points in the knowledge skill. You cannot converse with your spirits, even if they are intelligent enough for conversation; you can only issue orders (including commands to provide information). You can gain the services of new spirits by visiting or communicating with the spirit plane or by visiting a physical location where spirits manifest themselves. Cost per spirit: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities. 

If your spirits are bound into physical objects (see Fetishes and Familiars, p. 26), and you must create or acquire a new object to gain a new spell, this is reduced to 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities.

Grimoire: This is like spirit trapping (see below), but you don’t have direct access to the spirit plane. Instead you have pacts with a number of beings whose sigils are bound into a book (or stored in a database, etc.). You can only call upon a pact by accessing the grimoire and taking time to review the sigil. Cost per slot: 5 points base + 3 points per point of abilities. 

Reconfigurable Mechanisms: You have internal or external machinery (such as cinematic nanotech) that is capable of performing different functions. You can work with a catalog of standard items, or add any improvised device whose design and operation you understand. New gizmos require a concept roll, but not a prototype roll – the mechanisms take care of that automatically. You’re limited to one concept roll per day unless you’re a Gadgeteer. Mechanisms external to your body are subject to signal jamming; internal devices are not. Normally this includes physical abilities and must be taken with some form of the Physical enhancement. Cost per slot: 6 points base + 4 points per point of abilities for internal mechanisms, or 3 points per point of base for external mechanisms."

        desc="This ability is similar to Alternate Form, but not limited to specific racial templates. You can assume any racial template, within certain limits. 

First, the racial template must already exist in your game world. The GM might design the template himself or take one from a GURPS worldbook, but you cannot design totally new templates for the purpose of Morph (you can adjust existing ones, though; see below). 

Second, you can only turn into a living being, or a formerly living being such as a vampire. To change into a machine requires a special enhancement. 

Finally, the template’s point value must be within a limit determined by the number of points you have in Morph. 

If you can assume any racial template worth no more than your native one, Morph costs 100 points. This makes many forms available – anything no more powerful than your native form. For a human, this includes cats, insects, owls, and wolves. If you can assume more powerful forms, add the difference between the maximum racial template cost and the cost of your native template to the base 100 points. For instance, a human who can take on any racial template worth up to 75 points would pay 175 points for Morph. You may improve this limit with earned character points. 

You can always take on the form of a being you can see or touch, provided its racial template cost does not exceed your maximum. Once you have assumed a form, you can opt to memorize it by concentrating for one minute. This allows you to shapeshift into that form at any time. You can memorize a number of forms equal to your IQ. If all your “slots” are full, you must overwrite a previously memorized form (your choice) to add the new form. 

As with Alternate Form, the racial template of whatever you turn into replaces your native racial template. You may not add traits to templates, but you may freely omit racial mental disadvantages (e.g., Bestial), and you may always choose to drop the racial IQ modifier from a template and use your own IQ. Such changes raise the cost of animal templates, which are cheap due to limited mental capabilities. If you intend to do this, you should spend more than the minimum 100 points on Morph. 

Morph includes the ability to make cosmetic changes. This lets you impersonate a specific member of any race you can turn into. You can always impersonate someone who is present – but to assume his form later on, you must commit a memory “slot” to that form. With enough points in Morph, you can use this function to improve appearance. For instance, 115 points in Morph would let you give yourself any appearance from Horrific to Handsome. Cosmetic changes still take the usual 10 seconds. 

Shapeshifting Races: Members of a race with the Morph ability must subtract the point cost of Morph from racial cost when determining what forms they can assume.

Variation of the Shapeshifting advantage."
        Sp_lim="Cosmetic: You can only change your outward appearance. Your abilities and racial template are unaffected. -50%. This limitation includes Mass Conservation, but not Retains Shape. 

Mass Conservation: All your forms have the same weight. If the weight of your native form falls outside the normal racial weight range for a race, you simply cannot become a member of that race. The GM should be merciless when enforcing this limitation – no 150-lb. mice or elephants! -20%. 

Retains Shape: You can only assume forms with the same number of limbs, body layout, posture, etc. as your native form. This would limit a human Morph to humanoids (e.g., elves and giants), a wolf Morph to horizontal quadrupeds, and a bird Morph to other birds. -20%.

Cannot Memorize Forms: You can’t memorize the forms you copy. To assume a form, you must always be able to see or touch the original. -50%.

Flawed: Every form you take is cosmetically imperfect in some way, which completely precludes impersonation. You still gain the abilities of your new form. Flawed is mutually incompatible with Cosmetic. -10%.

Needs Sample: You must physically sample anything you wish to take the form of. If your target is living, this sample must be fresh – you can’t sample a rotting corpse. -5% if you need only touch the target; -15% if you require a drop of blood, strand of hair, etc.; -50% if you must eat the whole target.

Unliving Forms Only: You can turn into objects but not creatures. You enjoy most of the capabilities of the Unlimited enhancement, but you can’t assume the template of anything alive. -0%.

Preventable: To change form, you have to speak a code phrase, make a special gesture, touch a magical talisman, or meet some other requirement. This takes no longer than the usual time, but you can be prevented from doing it by mundane methods such as gagging you. If you depend on an external physical object to make the change, you can also take suitable gadget limitations. -10%"
        Sp_enh="Unlimited: You can become anything the GM has defined with a racial template. This lets you turn into robots, vehicles, etc. as well as living beings. Most ordinary inanimate objects – such as bricks and toasters – are worth 0 points or less. With the GM’s permission, you can become a typical example of an object like this without the need for a specific racial template. +50%.

Active Change: Your transformation takes the usual amount of time, but you needn’t concentrate during this time – you can move and act. You have the abilities of the form you’re changing from until the transition is complete. (GMs who enjoy extra detail can average the forms’ statistics, or even use a weighted average to reflect how far along the change has come.) +20%.

Improvised Forms: You can improvise new racial templates as you change, mixing and matching the natural physical traits you desire. Possibilities range from modifying your native form with a useful body part to creating a completely new template. Improvised templates can’t cost more than what you can afford with your Morph ability, but can include physical disadvantages to reduce costs. All traits added must exist in your game world, unless you also have Cosmic (+50%). You can’t change your composition (e.g., add elemental meta-traits or Insubstantiality) without Unlimited (+50%). +100%.

Success on this roll gives your allies an immediate Will roll to recover from mental stun (at +1 if you have Penetrating Voice or Voice).

The player declares a specific action for each of his allies to be affected by this ability, who must follow that course of action exactly. The player then makes a Leadership roll; for every 3 points by which he succeeds, all allies he directed gain +1 to their die rolls that round. If an ally cannot take his prescribed course of action or chooses not to do so, the bonus for all other allies is reduced by one.

Use Innate Attack skill to hit your target (or Brawling, if you have Projected, above). You can still use it in melee.

Ammo never runs out by default, but modifiers like Limited Use and Takes Recharge can change this; if so, they only apply to ranged use, never melee use. +100%.

Resilient: Your natural weapon is hard to break. For +10%, your weapon is considered to be of fine quality for parrying purposes and has twice DR; +20% makes it very fine and multiplies DR by 5; +40% makes it utterly unbreakable. Note that even an unbreakable weapon may be swept aside by a heavier one, and if an enemy severs the body part it is attached to, you lose it for good!

Swing-Capable: You can deal swing damage with your weapon. Remember that a swing/impaling weapon can get stuck (p. B405).

Possibilities include magic, psi, spirit, and anything else the GM deems susceptible to neutralization. If “super-powers” are a distinct phenomenon with a single source, the GM might allow Neutralize against those, too. To affect powers from more than one source, buy Neutralize multiple times.

To use Neutralize, you must touch the subject. This requires an Attack maneuver in melee combat. On a hit, roll a Quick Contest of Will. Your victim gets a bonus equal to his best Talent with any of the powers affected. For instance, a psi with ESP Talent 4 and Telepathy Talent 2 would resist Neutralize (Psi) at +4.

If you win, you neutralize your victim’s powers for minutes equal to your margin of victory. Should enhancements or super-tech (such as “neutralization manacles”) generate an effect that continuously neutralizes the target, this is the residual duration after shutting off the ability or removing the item. If you lose or tie, there’s no effect – but critical failure on your Will roll cripples this ability for 1d hours.

Once you’ve neutralized a given subject, you can’t affect him again until his powers recover. Multiple attackers can use Neutralize on the same target. Use only the longest duration; their abilities don’t “add” in any way.

One Ability: You can only neutralize one specific ability within one particular power; for instance, just Mind Probe within the Telepathy power or just Innate Attack within the Heat/Fire power. This is incompatible with Precise. -80%.

One Power: You can only neutralize one specific power that stems from a source that has multiple powers associated with it. The most common example is a single psi power (such as ESP or Telepathy). -50%.

Interruption: You cannot truly neutralize a psi’s powers, but if you win a Quick Contest of Will, you can negate one instance of them, canceling one psi’s abilities as they affect one specific target. For example, you could force a telepath out of someone’s head or force a teke to drop something. He can try again on his next turn, as a repeated attempt (p. 6). You must touch the psi or the target.

You still can’t drain Talents, or advantages without power modifiers. Cosmic doesn’t automatically overcome resistance.

Power Theft: You temporarily acquire the powers you neutralize – including all their enhancements and limitations – for the duration.

Precise: You can neutralize specific powers of the affected source, or even individual abilities. For instance, you could use Neutralize (Psi) to drain Telepathy only, or just telepathic Mind Probe, or everything but Mind Probe. To exclude or target a capability, you must know that your victim has it, and you must declare your intentions before you attack. +20%.

Derangable: You can choose to either neutralize or Derange (GURPS Powers, p. 97) your target when you declare your attack. +10%. 

Power Theft, Weak: As for Power Theft, but if your subject has multiple psionic powers, you only Neutralize (and steal) the abilities of one of them, determined randomly.

		desc="You are sensitive to omens, and see hidden significance in such things as the way plants grow, the behavior of animals, and even changes in the weather and the sky. Once per day, you may check the omens. This normally requires at least an hour, but if the GM has something in particular he wants to communicate, he may arbitrarily put it in your path. The GM rolls twice, in secret, when you use this ability: once to determine whether you discover the omen, once to see if you interpret it correctly. 

Discovery: To detect an omen requires a Sense roll. On a success, you discover the omen; on a critical success, you get +5 on the subsequent interpretation roll. On a failure, you find nothing of oracular significance. On a critical failure, the GM lies – he tells you that you have found an omen, but this is, in reality, a product of your own fears or wishes. 

Interpretation: To interpret an omen requires an IQ roll. On a success, the omen is very general; e.g., “an enemy approaches” or “a great power, long dormant, is stirring.” On a critical success, the information is more specific: “you risk the wrath of the king,” “seek out the mage in the tower,” etc. On a failure, the omen is simply too vague to be useful. On a critical failure, you blatantly misinterpret the omen – possibly in a dangerous manner.

		desc="A “Patron” is an NPC – or even an entire organization – that serves as your advisor, employer, mentor, or protector. An employer must be exceptional to qualify as a Patron, though; a Patron is much more than an ordinary boss! 
		
Power: The base point cost of a Patron depends on its power. Use the categories below as a guide, but note that some Patrons won’t fit neatly into any of them. The GM’s word is final. 
A powerful individual (usually built on at least 150% of the PC’s starting points) or a fairly powerful organization (assets of at least 1,000 times starting wealth for the world). 10 points. 

An extremely powerful individual (built on at least twice the PC’s starting points) or a powerful organization (assets of at least 10,000 times starting wealth). Examples: a limited manifestation of a minor god, a billionaire, or a big-city police department. 15 points.

An ultra-powerful individual (built on as many points as the GM wants!) or a very powerful organization (assets of at least 100,000 times starting wealth). Examples: a super, a limited manifestation of a major god, or a big city. 20 points.

An extremely powerful organization (assets of at least 1 million times starting wealth). Examples: a large corporation or a very small nation. 25 points. 

A national government or giant multinational organization (net worth basically incalculable), or a true god who appears personally to intervene on your behalf. 30 points. 

Note that the base cost to have a deity as a Patron is comparable to that for a powerful mundane Patron, but divine power requires the Special Abilities enhancement (see below), which will greatly increase the final cost of a divine Patron! 

Frequency of Appearance: Choose a frequency of appearance, as explained under Frequency of Appearance (p. 36). If the GM determines that your Patron appears at the start of an adventure, he may design the adventure to include an assignment or aid from the Patron. He may also choose to leave out your Patron, if its appearance would make no sense or disrupt the adventure. 

However, if the GM determined that your Patron could have appeared, and you try to contact your Patron during the adventure (for help, advice, etc.), then the contact is likely to be successful and you may receive aid. (Within reason – if you’re locked in a dungeon without any means of communication, you won’t be contacting anybody.) You will not know whether your Patron is “available” on a given adventure until you attempt to request aid. As a rule, you should only be able to reach your Patron for help once per adventure. 

Remember that a powerful Patron could be helpful without actually intervening! A Chicago hood who can say, “I’m from Big Eddie,” or a crimefighter who can flash a Q-clearance card, may carry some extra weight in a tough spot. 

Party Patrons: Often, several PCs – perhaps the entire party – share a Patron (they are all agents of the same government, servants of the same cult, etc.). No matter how many characters share a Patron, the cost is not shared; each character must pay full price for the Patron. On the other hand, the GM will make an appearance roll for each character at the start of each adventure – and if the Patron appears for any of them, then it is usually available for all of them. The GM should scale the quality and quantity of the aid provided in proportion to the number of successful appearance rolls. 

Drawbacks of Patrons: If your Patron is an army, corporation, feudal lord, etc., you may owe it a Duty (p. 133). A god or similar Patron may require a stringent code of behavior in return for its aid; see Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). A Patron might also have powerful foes that are now your foes; this can give you an Enemy (p. 135). Such factors can cut the effective cost of a Patron significantly, and turn it from a benefit to a considerable liability! 

Employers and Patrons: Not every employer is a Patron. If you can depend on your employer to get you out of trouble (at least sometimes), it might really be a Patron. Otherwise, it’s just a job. For example, a small police department is a 10-point Patron if, as most do, it takes care of its own. But the U.S. Army, though powerful, is not a likely Patron – at least for an ordinary trooper. You could say, “The Colonel takes care of his men.” But you could just as easily say, “I’m on my own if I get in trouble,” and play a soldier who does not have a Patron."
		Sp_lim="Minimal Intervention: Your Patron is less useful than its power level would suggest. On a successful appearance roll, the GM makes a reaction roll for your Patron to determine whether it actually provides aid; see Requests for Aid (p. 562). On a Neutral or better reaction, you receive the aid your Patron thinks you need – which may or may not be what you want. This is the classic modifier for gods who have many other minions to aid, and frequently accompanies the Pact limitation (see p. 113). -50%. 

Secret: Your Patron works behind the scenes. You do not know who it is and you cannot request aid directly. You might be able to call for help in such a way that the Patron gets the message (GM’s decision), but there is no guarantee that the Patron will take action. The only evidence of this kind of Patron is minor incidents and “lucky breaks.” This may take the form of information, equipment, or even direct aid . . . but only when it suits the Patron, and always in an untraceable way. A Patron like this often regards its aid as an investment on which it expects some return; therefore, it might not have your best interests at heart! Only the GM knows any of these details. You know nothing other than the fact that you have a Patron. -50%. 

Unwilling: You obtained your Patron through coercion (e.g., blackmail). It provides aid only because there is no other choice, and it definitely does not have your best interests at heart! You will eventually make one request too many (GM’s judgment – perhaps if the appearance roll comes up 18) and lose the Patron: remove the Patron from your character sheet and lower your point value accordingly. Since a Patron is by definition more powerful than you are, taking an Unwilling Patron is risky. If the Patron can find a way to break your “hold,” it will, and may well become an Enemy! -50%."
		Sp_enh="Equipment: Your Patron supplies useful equipment that you can use for your own purposes, and that you would otherwise have to buy. This enhancement only applies if the equipment is yours once given. A soldier with a military Patron would not pay extra for his weapons, since when he goes off duty, he can’t take them along. An adventurer in the employ of a generous noble who hands out useful “gifts” would pay extra. +50% if the equipment is worth no more than the average starting wealth in the campaign, or +100% if it is worth more than that. 

Highly Accessible: You can attempt to contact your Patron at any time – even when you are locked in a dungeon, lost in the desert, etc. This is most appropriate if your Patron is a spirit, a god you can petition via prayer, etc. +50%. 

Special Abilities: Your Patron wields power out of proportion to its wealth or point value. +50% if your Patron has extensive social or political power (e.g., the Governor of New York or the Pope), or +100% if your Patron has magical powers in a nonmagical world, possesses equipment from a TL greater than yours, grants you special powers, or has unusual reach in time or space (e.g., a super, spirit, or god)."

Each level of Payload lets you carry up to Basic Lift/10 lbs. inside you. Those without Injury Tolerance (Homogenous) (p. 60) or the Machine meta-trait (p. 263) should ask the GM’s permission before taking more than five levels of Payload. You must allocate your Payload between cargo and occupants when you buy the advantage: Cargo: 20 lbs. of cargo space is roughly equal to one cubic foot of capacity. A typical car has about 10-20 cubic feet of storage space; a semi-trailer has about 2,400 cf. Occupants: A human-sized being requires about 200 lbs. of capacity. For others, take average racial weight and increase it by 1/3. An actual cabin requires 10 times that weight. Your defensive advantages (DR, Sealed, etc.) also protect your occupants.

Treat your Payload as part of your body, not as encumbrance or carried weight, when calculating Move and using advantages with limited carrying capacity, such as Invisibility, Jumper, and Warp. Machines that can push or pull large external loads – or pick them up and carry them with arms, cranes, etc. – have Lifting ST (p. 65), not Payload.

However, you cannot survive outside a living host. Should your current body die, you will die! Thus, you must keep your current host alive . . . at least until you can find a replacement. 

To possess a new host, you must concentrate for one second and physically touch him. Attempts to possess your own Puppet (p. 78) succeed automatically. In all other cases, roll a Quick Contest: your IQ vs. the subject’s Will. Your victim resists at +5 if he is in combat with you or otherwise wary of you, so it is best to be subtle.

If you lose or tie, you are mentally stunned for 1d seconds. In addition, you may never attempt to possess that subject again – he is “immune” to you. 

If you win, you take over your victim’s body, completely suppressing his personality. Your previous host regains control of his body (if sentient) after 1d seconds of mental stun, and “comes to” with no memory of the possession. 

You gain your new host’s ST, DX, and HT (and secondary characteristics calculated from these scores), as well as his physical advantages and disadvantages. You keep your own IQ, Perception, and Will, and all of your mental traits. Your social traits may apply, depending on the laws and values of your society. 

Skills are a special case. Your IQ-, Perception-, and Will-based skills are unchanged. Other skills remain at the same relative skill level. For instance, if you have Acrobatics at DX+3, then you would have Acrobatics-12 in a DX 9 body and Acrobatics-14 in a DX 11 body.

To recall a specific fact from the host’s memories, you must roll vs. IQ, at -1 per hour since the takeover. Only one attempt is allowed for any given memory! 

If you occupy a host for a long time, or hop between multiple bodies, the GM is free to adjust your point value to reflect the most expensive body you regularly occupy.

        Sp_lim="Digital: This limitation is only available to Digital Minds (p. 48). You take over computers, not living bodies. The target system must be connected to your current host computer via a network, and you must have complete access to it – voluntary or otherwise (see Computer Hacking, p. 184). The target computer’s hardware must be complex enough to run your computer program; in general, its Complexity must be at least half your IQ (round up). You can also take over a computer using a copy of yourself while leaving the original intact! However, unless you have the Digital version of Duplication (p. 50), any system you take over this way becomes an independent NPC that thinks it is you. -40%. 

Magical: Your advantage is an innate magic talent. If the subject is protected by a spell that repels hostile magic, you must win a Quick Contest of your IQ vs. that spell before you can make a possession attempt. If your victim has Magic Resistance, it subtracts from your IQ and adds to his Will during the actual possession attempt. -10%. 

Mindlink Required: You can only possess someone with whom you have a Mindlink. If the link is ever jammed, out of range, etc., the possession ends. If the Mindlink has the Telecommunication limitation, Mindlink Required can represent control via an implant, telepresence, or similar technology. -40%. 

No Memory Access: You have no access to your host’s memories. -10%. 

Parasitic: You enter your host’s body physically. You must have Permeation (Flesh) (p. 75) to do this, unless your host has sufficient Payload (p. 74) to contain you – and your victim must have a higher Size Modifier than you. After entering your victim’s body, you may attempt to possess him. He resists with the higher of HT or Will. You aren’t forced out if you lose, but he is “immune” to you, so you need to find another host soon. While you are in someone else’s body, he (if he is still uncontrolled) or his friends might be able to use technological means to detect you – and possibly remove you. Attacks that penetrate or ignore your host’s DR can injure you, but his HP act as extra DR for this purpose. If you are microbial, you should purchase Injury Tolerance (Diffuse) (p. 60), which will protect you. The host nourishes you, and may have to eat extra food as a result. You can choose to leave at any time, the same way you entered. You may also temporarily release your host while continuing occupation. If you do, you will have to win a new Quick Contest to regain control. -60%. 

Puppet Only: You may possess your own Puppets automatically, but you cannot possess anyone else. -30%. 

Spiritual: You must have the Spirit meta-trait (p. 263) to take this limitation. Your spirit body merges with and occupies the body of your host. It remains insubstantial during the possession, traveling inside the host but otherwise inaccessible to you and effectively mindless. It can be injured as detailed under Parasitic, but only by attacks that affect insubstantial things. A genuine exorcist can cast you out by winning a Quick Contest of his exorcism ability vs. your Will. You cannot return to a body you have been cast out of for at least 24 hours. You may choose to release your host at any time. If you are exorcised or leave voluntarily, the host recovers after 1d seconds of mental stun. -20%. 

Telepathic: Your ability is part of the Telepathy psi power (see p. 257). -10%.

Specialized: You can only possess certain hosts. The default is “anything alive.” All Carbon-Based Life is -10%; All Earthly Life is -20%; Animals Only is -25%; All Mammals, All Reptiles, etc., is -30%; and Dogs Only, Humans Only, Martians Only, etc., is -40%.

Poor Control: You have difficulty getting used to your new bodies. You suffer a flat penalty to Acting (to impersonate the subject). You also receive a penalty to every ST-, DX-, and HT-based roll you make (with the exception of passive rolls, such as resistance or staying conscious) while possessing someone, and you get half that penalty (round down) to every active defense. This cannot be combined with Digital or Cybernetic Only, unless mobile robots are the most common forms of computer in the setting. For penalties that can be negated with eight hours of practice: -5% for a -1 penalty; -10% for -2; -15% for -4; and -20% for -8. If it takes you 40 hours to overcome these penalties, double the value of the limitation. If no amount of practice will negate the familiarity penalty, triple the value."

For instance, if you do not know Acrobatics, but your host knows it at DX+3, you can pick it up at DX+2 . . . if you have enough points. Skills forgotten in order to learn new skills are gone. Skills learned from your host will move from body to body with you. +10%. 

Chronic: When you exit a host, you can leave a “back door” that lets you possess him again without a Quick Contest. This lets you buy your former host as a Puppet. You can only use this enhancement if you have enough unspent points to buy a Puppet at the time you leave your host. +20%. 

Mind Swap: Your host’s mind moves into your previous body instead of being suppressed – in effect, you “trade places.” +10%. 

Telecontrol: You remotely control your new host as if he were a puppet, leaving your original body in a trance. You may choose to return to your body at any time, and must do so if your host falls unconscious or dies (but not if he sleeps). As a result, you do not die if your host dies. +50%.

Full Memory Access: You can freely access the memories of a sentient host at any time. To recall a specific fact from the subject’s memories requires a straight IQ roll, at no penalty for the time since takeover. Furthermore, if you also have Assimilation, you can learn the victim’s IQ-, Will-, and Perception-based skills. +10%.

Telecontrol 2: As Telecontrol, but your body remains conscious and able to act. You can only exercise fine control over one body at a time, though. State whether you’re prioritizing your body or your victim’s (in combat, do this at the start of each turn). All actions taken by the lower-priority body – including attack, defense, and Sense rolls – are at -4. This is incompatible with Parasitic and Spiritual, which assume that you and your victim are merged in a single body. If you have Compartmentalized Mind (p. B43), you don’t need this modifier, as some compartments can possess victims while others control your body. Without Telesend (p. B91), though, the “home” and “away” compartments won’t be in communication. +100%."

		desc="A deity – god, demon lord, great spirit, cosmic power, etc. – has empowered you to cast “clerical” spells. Add your Power Investiture to your IQ when you learn spells granted by the deity who bestowed this advantage. For instance, IQ 12 and Power Investiture 2 (Thor) would let you learn spells granted by the god Thor (and only Thor) as if you had IQ 14. 

You may only learn clerical spells from a fixed list set by your deity, who may even dictate which specific spells you learn. The GM determines this list and takes on the role of your deity when you wish to learn new spells. However, because you are channeling divine will as opposed to studying magic, clerical spells do not have prerequisites. 

In general, the more Power Investiture you have, the “holier” you are. The maximum level of Power Investiture depends on your deity, as determined by the GM. Minor deities who have a limited ability to transfer power to their chosen, or a small range of possible spell effects, might grant only one level, while major deities might be more generous. 

Note that Power Investiture is a measure of your bond with your deity, while Clerical Investment (p. 43) and Religious Rank (p. 30) measure social power. These need not be related. Power Investiture might be restricted to high-ranking clerics . . . but a deity can grant power to anyone it wants (possibly to the chagrin of the church!). 

In some cases, you can add or increase Power Investiture in play. What this entails depends on the deity. To gain, keep, or improve Power Investiture, you nearly always have to take and adhere to one or more of the traits listed under Self-Imposed Mental Disadvantages (p. 121). If you break these vows, you will lose some or all of your powers – perhaps until you have made proper penance, perhaps permanently. In effect, Power Investiture comes with a built-in Pact limitation (see p. 113); do not apply this modifier again. 

You may also need to meet certain physical requirements. Some deities only empower men, women, eunuchs, virgins . . . the GM should be creative. Should you lose a special requirement (such as virginity), your Power Investiture may be diminished or lost, reducing your point value accordingly. 

You can have both Magery and Power Investiture (unless your deity forbids this), but Magery does not improve clerical spells and Power Investiture does not aid magical spells. The clerical and magical versions of a given spell are entirely different spells, and clerical spells never count as prerequisites for magical spells. If you know both versions of a spell, they do not affect one another. 

Power Investiture is one possible way to handle “holy powers.” It is most appropriate in settings where priests are divinely inspired wizards."

        desc="You receive glimpses of future events. You cannot control the content of these flashes – you just know that something interesting or important might happen, at some unspecified future date. You might learn this through visions, voices, or “sudden knowledge.” A vivid premonition of a terrible event might even require a Fright Check (p. 360)! 

Precognition only gives information that your “future self” could learn and that would matter to you. For instance, if you’re in New York, you are unlikely to have a premonition about a random murder in Los Angeles. But if the victim was a friend, or if the killing was important enough to make national news, you might “flash” on it. 

Nothing about the future is certain, though. Even if the GM has made up his mind, he could reconsider . . . although something related to the premonition should still happen. In most settings, predicted events will occur unless you take specific action to prevent them. 

Whenever the GM feels a premonition would be appropriate, he will secretly make an IQ roll for you – usually during an encounter with a person or object. For instance, meeting someone with an important event in his future might set off a premonition related to that event, especially if it would affect you in some way. Similarly, seeing a picture of a place could set off a vision involving that location. 

A deliberate attempt to use Precognition requires 10 minutes of concentration, 2 FP, and an IQ roll at -8. You can attempt to read your own future, or that of another person. To deliberately read the future of someone else, you must be able to touch him. 

Precognition is normally limited to “seeing” into the near future – perhaps a week or so. At the GM’s option, however, a critical success or a very important event might result in visions from much further in the future. 

Note that Precognition includes Danger Sense (p. 47) – do not take both."

A native pressure other than 1 atmosphere is a 0-point feature, but if you can survive for a prolonged period of time at a wide range of pressures, you have an advantage. This trait comes in three levels: 

Pressure Support 1: You can survive at pressures between your native pressure and 10 times that. (This would enable a human to survive on most of Earth’s continental shelves.) 5 points. 

Pressure Support 2: You can withstand pressures between your native pressure and 100 times that. (This would enable a human to survive anywhere in Earth’s oceans, save the deepest trenches.) 10 points. 

Pressure Support 3: You are immune to the effects of high pressure. 15 points. 

Pressure Support lets your body stay at a constant internal pressure with respect to a constant and uniform external pressure. This protects against attacks that manipulate ambient pressure or crush the entire body, but provides no defense against localized or transient pressure changes. In particular, Pressure Support does not reduce or prevent damage from crushing attacks or explosions of any kind.

        type="Social"
        category="—"
        desc="Specific sectors of society – e.g., the civil service, the military, and certain powerful religions – often have internal ranking systems, distinct from Status. If an organization like this has significant social influence, or access to useful resources, then its members must pay points for their rank within the organization. 

Rank comes in levels. Each Rank has authority over those of lower Rank – regardless of personal ability. In most cases, there are six to eight levels of Rank. The GM should determine the highest Rank available to starting characters, usually Rank 3-5. 

Unlike Status, Rank costs no money to maintain. On the other hand, almost all forms of Rank come with a Duty (see p. 133). Rank often has stringent prerequisites, too – typically one of the traits given under Privilege (p. 30) or a minimum skill level. These things have their own point costs, not included in the cost of the Rank. 

In a given society, there are usually several systems of Rank; the precise varieties depend on the game world. In most cases, you may hold more than one kind of Rank, although the GM is free to rule that holding one sort of Rank precludes holding another. 

Rank may coexist with Status. If so, then high Rank grants additional Status at no extra cost: +1 to Status at Rank 2-4, +2 to Status at Rank 5-7, and +3 to Status at Rank 8 or higher. This represents society’s respect for senior members of important social institutions. If you hold multiple types of Rank, then you may claim a Status bonus for each of them. 

Alternatively, one form of Rank might replace Status; for instance, Religious Rank in a theocracy. In societies like this, Status does not exist. Each level of Rank gives all its usual benefits plus the effect of an equivalent level of Status.

Rank is worth 5 points per level if it coexists with Status, or 10 points per level if it replaces Status. Common varieties of Rank include: 

Administrative Rank: Position within a governmental bureaucracy. When dealing with other administrators, differences in Rank work just like differences in Status (see p. 28). At TL5 and higher, a large bureaucracy might have several varieties of Rank: one per government department, and possibly extra categories for the senate, judiciary, etc. (Defense or law-enforcement officials use Military or Police Rank instead.) Note this on your character sheet; e.g., Administrative Rank (Judiciary). 

Merchant Rank: Position within a national or transnational organization of merchants. This could be anything from the mercantile culture of the Aztecs (where Merchant Rank verged on being Status) to the “merchant marine” of a modern or futuristic society (where Merchant Rank often parallels Military Rank during wartime). 

Military Rank: Position within a military organization. Each organization is structured differently. In general, personnel that are not specifically leaders will be Rank 0-2, while lowlevel officers and senior enlisted men will be Rank 3-4. Rank 5 and higher is normally limited to major commands and duties where the officer is responsible for extremely valuable or rare resources. Limited-duty officers, specialists, and personnel with little actual responsibility or command authority have a lower Rank in GURPS terms, despite possibly possessing titles identical to those of a higher Rank; represent this with one or more levels of Courtesy Rank (see Courtesy Rank, p. 29) 

Police Rank: Position in a police force. Each agency has its own variety of Rank. You must buy Legal Enforcement Powers (p. 65) before you can buy Police Rank; this is the difference between a patrol officer (Police Rank 0, for 0 points) and an ordinary citizen (no Police Rank, also 0 points). Note that in a police state, there is no difference between Police Rank and Military Rank. 

Religious Rank: Position in a religious hierarchy. Each religion has its own variety of Rank. You must buy Clerical Investment (p. 43) before you can buy Religious Rank; this is the difference between a novice (Religious Rank 0, for 0 points) and a layperson (no Religious Rank, also 0 points). Other common requirements include a minimum level of Theology skill and being of a particular sex or race. Differences in Rank work just like differences in Status (see p. 28) when dealing with co-religionists and those who respect your faith.

Guild Rank: Position within an organization that holds exclusive license to practice a profession in a city, and to enforce standards for it. This costs 2 points/level (1 for titles, 1 for typical resources, and 0 for dominance) and, as noted above, is typically limited to four levels. A nationwide guild can have a full eight levels. 

Magical Rank: Position within a hierarchical professional association of mages. Similar to Guild Rank but also grants special resources, raising the cost to 3/level.

Organized Crime Rank: Position within the mafia, yakuza, or a similar criminal syndicate with an official command hierarchy. Costs 2 points/level if the group is one of several competing organizations (1 for titles, 1 for chain of command, 1 for typical resources, and -1 for lacking dominance) or 3 points/level for a unified organization (as above, but 0 for dominance). The range of levels varies greatly, but should be consistent with the scale of operations. 

Servant Rank: Position within the staff of a large household with many servants. Typically, 1 point/level (1 for titles, 1 for chain of command, and -1 for lacking dominance) up to no more than four levels. For the household of an emperor or powerful king, 2 points/level (1 for titles, 1 for chain of command, 0 for dominance) and up to eight levels."

        desc="It is possible to be so well-known that your reputation becomes an advantage or a disadvantage. This affects reaction rolls made by NPCs (see p. 494). A reputation has four elements: Details, Reaction Modifier, People Affected, and Frequency of Recognition. 

Details: The details of your reputation are entirely up to you; you can be known for bravery, ferocity, eating green snakes, or whatever you want. However, you must give specifics. Reputation is, by definition, something noteworthy; there is no such thing as a “generic” reputation. 

Reaction Modifier: Specify the reaction-roll modifier that you get from people who recognize you. This determines the base cost of your reputation. For every +1 bonus to reaction rolls (up to +4), the cost is 5 points. For every -1 penalty (up to -4), the cost is -5 points. 

People Affected: The size of the group of people who might have heard of you modifies the base cost: Almost everyone in your game world (but not those from other universes – at least, not until they have met you!): x1. Almost everyone in your game world except one large class (everyone but the French, everyone but Elves, everyone but offworld visitors): x2/3 (round down). Large class of people (all people of a particular faith, all mercenaries, all tradesmen, etc.): x1/2 (round down). Small class of people (all priests of Wazoo, all literate people in 12th-century England, all mages in modern Alabama): x1/3 (round down). 

If the class of people affected is so small that, in the GM’s opinion, you would not meet even one in the average adventure, your reputation isn’t worth points. This depends on the setting; for instance, mercenary soldiers are rare in some game worlds, common in others. 

Frequency of Recognition: Either your name or your face is enough to trigger a “reputation roll” to see if the people you meet have heard of you. Roll once for each person or small group you meet. For a large group, the GM may roll more than once if he likes. The frequency with which you are recognized modifies the cost of your reputation: 
All the time: x1. 
Sometimes (roll of 10 or less): x1/2 (round down). 
Occasionally (roll of 7 or less): x1/3 (round down). 

Of course, your reputation extends only within a certain area. If you travel far enough away, the GM may require you to “buy off” the disadvantage points you received for a bad reputation. (There is no corresponding bonus for losing a good reputation.) 

Multiple Reputations: You may have more than one reputation, and your reputations can overlap. The GM should check each one before determining how an NPC reacts to you. Your total reaction modifier from reputations cannot be better than +4 or worse than -4 in a given situation. 

Multifaceted Reputations: A single reputation can give different reaction modifiers with different groups, provided the groups do not overlap. Set the reaction modifier for each group, modify the cost for the size of the group, and then add up the resulting costs. Modify this total for frequency of recognition. The reputation is an advantage if the net point cost is positive, a disadvantage if negative. The final point cost may be 0, but you should still record it on your character sheet!"

The bonus from Resistant applies to all rolls to resist noxious effects within a particular category – usually some combination of disease, poison, and environmental syndromes (altitude sickness, the bends, space sickness, etc.). It also applies to rolls to resist attacks that use these effects. This includes Afflictions with one of Blood Agent, Contact Agent, Follow-Up, or Respiratory Agent, and Innate Attacks that have such modifiers and inflict toxic or fatigue damage. 

Resistant does not protect against effects that Damage Resistance or Protected Sense either stop or provide a HT bonus to resist. This includes Afflictions and Innate Attacks that do not have any of the modifiers given above. 

The base cost for Resistant depends on the rarity of the effects it counteracts: 

Very Common: A broad category within the noxious items described above. Example: Metabolic Hazards (all threats that only affect the living, including all disease and poison, plus such syndromes as altitude sickness, bends, seasickness, and jet lag). 30 points. 

Common: A group of related items encountered as often in nature as in an attack, or some other suitably broad subset of “Very Common.” Example: Poison (all toxins, but not asphyxiants or corrosives) or Sickness (all diseases and environmental syndromes). 15 points. 

Occasional: A group of closely related items more often encountered in nature than as a deliberate attack, or a subset of a “Common” group. Examples: Disease (all bacteria, viruses, fungus infections, etc.) or Ingested Poison. 10 points. 

Rare: A specific item or environmental syndrome, or a subset of an “Occasional” group. Examples: Acceleration (blackouts due to extreme G-forces), Altitude Sickness, Bends (decompression sickness), Seasickness, or Space Sickness; Nanomachines. 5 points. Multiply base cost to reflect your degree of resistance: 

You are totally immune to all noxious effects, and never have to make resistance rolls (write this as “Immunity” on your character sheet): x1. 

You have +8 to all HT rolls to resist: x1/2. 

You have +3 to all HT rolls to resist: x1/3. 

Drop all fractions from the final cost. 

An ordinary human could believably have any level of resistance to a mundane “Rare” item, such as Seasickness. He might also have Resistant to Disease (+3) [3], Resistant to Disease (+8) [5], or Resistant to Poison (+3) [5]. Anything more would be superhuman. Golems, robots, undead, and other beings that are not truly “alive” must take Immunity to Metabolic Hazards [30]; this is already included in the Machine meta-trait (p. 263). When in doubt, the GM’s word is final. 

Mental Resistance: It is possible to be Resistant to a purely mental threat. This works as described above, except that the bonus applies to resistance rolls against IQ and Will instead of HT. “Psionics” is an allowed category, and is considered Very Common."

        desc="You can emit energy, bounce it off objects, and analyze the returned signal to build up a “picture” of your surroundings. This lets you discern size and shape, but not color or fine detail (such as writing). It has nothing to do with the normal human sense of sight, and requires no light. As a result, you may ignore darkness penalties in combat. Perception is limited to a 120° arc in front of you. 

Your sense is “active.” Anyone who can sense the signal you emit can detect you, out to twice your own range. Unlike other sensory advantages, however, you can turn this ability off; see Turning Advantages Off and On (p. 34). 

Below are several varieties of Scanning Sense. Each is a separate advantage, with its own special rules. Where these rules contradict the general ones given above, follow the special rules. Each sense also has a base range. To adjust this, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). 

Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses radio waves. Base range is 2,000 yards. You can only detect large (human-sized or larger), dense objects. On a Sense roll, you get a general idea of the relative size of the object, and whether it is moving, but nothing more precise. You cannot get an actual “image” with Radar, or use it to aim attacks. Radar works best on flying targets; roll at -4 to spot anyone who is not silhouetted against the sky. Radar does not work at all underwater. 20 points. 

Imaging Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses millimeter-wave radar. Base range is 200 yards. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Imaging Radar can see through thin fabric or vegetation. You get +3 to locate objects like concealed weapons, and may ignore penalties for spotting objects hidden behind light brush. Ordinary radar detectors detect Imaging Radar at -4. Imaging Radar does not work underwater. 20 points. 

Ladar: Your Scanning Sense uses a laser beam. Base range is 200 yards. Ladar is very similar to Imaging Radar, but the beam is narrower and offers better resolution. This gives -4 on rolls to locate objects of interest, but +4 on rolls to identify them. Only specialized ladar detectors can detect Ladar, and at -4 even then. Ladar cannot penetrate dense smoke or solid objects. It has 10-50% range in falling rain or snow, and 1% range underwater. 20 points. 

Para-Radar: Your Scanning Sense uses energy unknown to 21st-century science. Treat Para-Radar as Imaging Radar, except that it functions in any environment! Ordinary radar detectors cannot detect Para-Radar, although some ultra-tech sensors might be able to do so. 40 points. 

Sonar: Your Scanning Sense uses ultrasonic sound waves. Base range is 2,000 yards underwater. You can spot small objects and determine their shape, but you must make a Sense roll to distinguish fine relief (e.g., to identify a face). Sonar does not function if you are deafened, and can be “jammed” or fooled by a very loud noise (e.g., an explosion). Individuals with Ultrahearing can detect Sonar. Sonar is much less effective in air: range is only 20 yards multiplied by air pressure in atmospheres (one atmosphere on Earth). Sonar is completely ineffective in vacuum. 20 points.

Field Sense: Your scanning sense relies on electric fields generated within your body. This works like standard Radar, but base range is 200 yards underwater, 20 yards in air or vacuum. In addition to its active functions, your field sense acts as a Detect for bioelectricity and for electrical power sources (including machines with the Electrical disadvantage). Your own sense’s electric field makes you easy to detect in the same way. 10 points.

Extra-Sensory Awareness: Your Scanning Sense uses waves of psionic energy to map the immediate area. Base range is only 20 yards, but it works in any environment. It can distinguish fine relief as perfectly as the human eye. Only psychotronic devices or people with Psi Sense (p. 41) can detect Extra-Sensory Awareness. Enhancements for Para-Radar can be applied to Extra-Sensory Awareness. 20 points."

        Sp_enh="Extended Arc: You can scan an arc greater than 120°. A 240° arc (as described for Peripheral Vision, p. 74) is +75%; a 360° arc (as described for 360° Vision, p. 34) is +125. 

Low-Probability Intercept (LPI): This is only available for Radar and Sonar. You can switch this enhancement on and off. Turning it on makes your signal difficult to detect. This halves range, but your Scanning Sense can only be detected at 1.5 times the halved range. +10%. 

Multi-Mode: This is only available for Radar. You can switch between Radar and Imaging Radar. (This is much cheaper than buying the two advantages separately, because they overlap to some extent.) +50%. 

Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can “lock onto” any object within range and determine its precise range and speed – just as if you had a high-tech rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%.

Bio-Scan: Para-Radar only. You receive vital signs and biochemical information from anything you scan – both the target itself and anything living on its surface. This lets you use skills like Biology and Diagnosis from a safe distance. With Penetrating, you can also examine living beings inside inanimate objects (e.g., the passengers of a car). +50%.

No Intercept: Your Scanning Sense is completely undetectable. This highly unrealistic enhancement mainly suits psis and supers. +50%.

Scanner: Para-Radar only. You receive detailed information about the composition, energy output, radiation emissions, etc. of anything you scan. This allows detailed analysis from a distance with scientific skills such as Chemistry and Physics. With Penetrating, you can spot specific systems within a complex machine and analyze them using Engineer skill. Sci-fi sensors typically have both enhancements – and often Bio-Scan, too. +50%."

        desc="You have the power to find almost any small item you desire in an alternate world and “snatch” it across the dimensions to you. The items you snatch do not come from your own world, but from some nameless parallel; therefore, you can never intentionally take something away from a specific other person. Note that this talent does not allow you to visit alternate worlds in person – only to steal from them. 

To make a snatch, you must first concentrate for 10 seconds and clearly visualize the item you want. The item must be able to fit in one hand, and cannot weigh more than 5 lbs. You should have a hand free (if your hands are tied, you roll at -3), and others can see you making “reaching” motions with that hand. 

Next, make an IQ roll for the snatch attempt. If you are trying for information in any form, the GM makes this roll for you (see below). Regardless of IQ, a roll of 14 or more always fails. 

On a success, the desired item appears in your hand – or sitting within arm’s reach, if you prefer. On a failure, you obtain nothing. On a critical failure, you snatched the wrong item! This item is not immediately dangerous unless you were trying for something dangerous. 

Regardless of success or failure, each snatch attempt costs 2 FP. 

Items Available: In theory, you can get anything. In practice, some things are so hard to find that it is little use trying for them. You have a good chance of getting any item that exists, or that ever existed, in your own world – or any reasonably similar item. If the desired item is unusual, the GM may apply a penalty to the IQ roll: 

Item is significantly different from anything that ever appeared in your own world: -1 or more (GM’s option). You could visualize “a perfect diamond, bright green, the size of a hen’s egg, carved into the shape of a typewriter,” but you might be rolling at -20! 

Item is unique or almost unique in any one world (e.g., the Hope Diamond): -3 or worse (GM’s option). 

You cannot clearly visualize what you want: -4 or worse (GM’s option). Even on a “success,” you might not get what you were really hoping for. 

You cannot get an item that works by natural laws wholly different from those in your world. For instance, if your world is nonmagical (or has no magic that you know of), you cannot snatch a magic item, because you are unable to visualize it properly; you would get a pretty but powerless mundane item. Similarly, if you are from a low-TL world, you could not get a laser pistol; you wouldn’t be able to visualize it well, and your best effort would be a broken or toy gun. (A generous GM might bend this rule on a critical success . . . and then let the poor Snatcher try to figure out how to use his amulet or laser pistol without killing himself.) 

Information is not available except in the form of “ordinary” textbooks, reports, etc. You can grab a history book, but you can’t ask for “The Book of What Happens Next in My Adventure.” Note that the GM makes the roll if information is requested. If the roll fails by 5 or more, the information comes from an alternate world with different history, physics, etc., and is wrong – maybe subtly, maybe not subtly at all! 

Repeated Attempts: If your snatch attempt is unsuccessful, you can immediately try to snatch the same or a similar object again. These “repeated attempts” are made at a cumulative -1 to the IQ roll. Each repeated attempt costs 4 FP instead of the usual 2 FP. To eliminate these penalties, wait one hour between attempts. 

The GM should be strict about attempts to circumvent this. For instance, a “.45 pistol” is not very different from a “.357 pistol” for the purpose of this advantage. Furthermore, ignore critical successes on repeated attempts made in quick succession. If the snatch being attempted is very difficult, there is little choice but to wait an hour between attempts. 

Duration: The objects you snatch remain until you voluntarily return them or use your Snatcher ability again. To keep objects indefinitely, take the Permanent enhancement (below)."
        Sp_lim="Less Weight: Your weight limit is lower than 5 lbs. (3 lbs. -5%; 2 lbs. -10%; 1 lb. -15%; 4 oz. -25%; 1 oz. -30%). 

Specialized: You can only grab a certain type of object, or cannot touch a certain class of thing. Examples: Only metal, -5%; Only money, -10%; Only weapons, -10%; Only information, -20%; No metal, -20%; Only blue things, -25%. The GM sets the limitation value using the guidelines under Accessibility (p. 110). 

Stunning: You are mentally stunned after a successful snatch. -10%. 

Unpredictable: On a failed IQ roll, you get something, but it isn’t what you wanted. The worse the failure, the more different the item is. If you wanted a loaded pistol, failure by 1 might bring an unloaded pistol. Failure by 2 could mean a water pistol, failure by 3 a book on “How to Shoot,” and so on . . . with a critical failure bringing a live hand grenade. Any critical failure is dangerous, regardless of what you were looking for! -25%.

Recall: You call existing objects to you across space or dimensions. These must be personal possessions. You could summon your sidearm – or even your battlesuit, with More Weight – but not someone else’s belongings, let alone items you’ve merely heard of. This still requires 10 seconds, 2 FP, and an IQ roll, but no penalties apply. Recalled items remain indefinitely, as if you had physically retrieved them. As usual, you can send the items back at any time. Recall is incompatible with Creation, Permanent, and Unpredictable. -25%."
        Sp_enh="Permanent: Objects you snatch don’t vanish when you use your ability again. The GM is free to forbid this enhancement, as it allows a single Snatcher to amass boundless wealth by snatching small, valuable objects. +300%.

Creation: You don’t take items from anywhere – you create them on the spot. You can get anything you’ve seen personally, and items sufficiently close to these things that you can visualize them. There are never any penalties for item type. You still can’t get “impossible” items, you can only have one created item at a time unless you also take Permanent, and normal weight and size limits apply. +100%.

Large Items: You’re not bound by the restriction that the items you snatch must fit in one hand. They can be any size, as long as they’re within your weight limit. Large items too heavy to lift always appear at arm’s reach. +50%.

More Weight: Your weight limit is higher than 5 lbs. 
Limit Cost Modifier 7 lbs. +5% 10 lbs. 
+10% 15 lbs. 
+15% 20 lbs. 
+20% 30 lbs. 
+25% 50 lbs. 

+30% Each further +30% multiplies weight by 10 (e.g., a ton is +80%). If your weight limit exceeds your onehanded lift (2xBL), you must also take the Large Items enhancement."

This is the opposite of Social Stigma (p. 155); membership in a given social group cannot result in both Social Regard and Social Stigma. 

Social Regard costs 5 points per +1 to reaction rolls, to a maximum of +4. This is not a Reputation, despite the similarities in cost and effect. You are treated well because of what you are, not because of who you are. Think of it as “privilege by association.” 

The way you are treated on a good reaction roll will depend on the type of Regard: 

Feared: Others will react to you much as if you had successfully used Intimidation skill (p. 202). Those who like you stand aside, while those who dislike you flee rather than risk a confrontation. You are met with silent deference, and perhaps even respect, but never friendly familiarity. Examples: a god among men or an Amazon warrior. 

Respected: You receive polite and obsequious deference, much as if you had high Status (p. 28), regardless of your actual Status. Social interactions other than combat usually go smoothly for you – but there will be times when the kowtowing gets in the way. Examples: a member of a priest caste or a ruling race. 

Venerated: Total strangers react to you in a caring way. They give up seats, let you ahead of them in lines, and receive your every word as pearls of wisdom. They also take great pains to prevent you from putting yourself in danger or even discomfort – even when you need to do so! Example: an elderly person in many societies.

Amusing: You’re naturally funny, or people are predisposed to consider you funny. This lets you get away with things that would get other people in trouble, precisely because you’re not taken seriously. A king’s fool or a class clown has this advantage. Many societies grant their children levels of this advantage (often decreasing as they get older); if so, it can coexist with Social Stigma (Minor).

Good Neighbor: You are treated with polite friendliness rather than deference or fear. People will do you small favors, pay attention to your opinions, and try to avoid offending you. This is generally a very beneficial, practical sort of regard, but if you try to claim superiority, other people will probably be puzzled rather than impressed."

Sorcerous Empowerment is used to cast improvised magic (pp. 6-8) – a crucial ability which compensates for a sorcerer’s usually limited grimoire. Just as important, it is the prerequisite for the spells (p. 5) that make sorcerers so powerful.

In addition, when one of your spells must resist countermagic, it does so with your Will plus the higher of Sorcerous Empowerment or Sorcery Talent.

In practice, most people refer to this advantage as “Sorcery” for short – that is, a spellcaster with Sorcerous Empowerment 8 is said to have “Sorcery 8” – but this supplement will always refer to it by its full name to keep the distinction between advantage and system clear. By default, Sorcerous Empowerment gives access to the full range of magic; a sorcerer can learn or improvise any spell that the GM allows. To limit this, see below."
        Sp_lim="Limited Colleges: For convenience, Sorcery separates its spells into the same colleges as GURPS Magic. If you can cast spells from only one of these colleges, this is a -40% limitation. Two colleges is -30%; three, -20%; and four (the maximum), -10%. This affects the spells you can learn and what you can improvise.

Limited Scope: At the GM’s option, you may be able to limit your Sorcerous Empowerment in a way that doesn’t line up perfectly with the spell colleges. If so, use the values above to find a reasonable limitation value. For example, “Limited Scope, Mind-altering spells” would be equivalent to two colleges (Communication and Empathy plus Mind Control) along with a modest collection of spells from the other colleges, and would thus be comparable to three colleges (-20%)."

Sorcery Talent adds to every roll made to cast a sorcerous spell or to use that spell well. For example, it adds to Innate Attack skill to hit with a Missile spell, to Engineer skill to brace a tunnel with magic, and so on. It even adds to Occultism or Thaumatology when rolling to answer questions about sorcery. Add the higher of Sorcerous Empowerment or Sorcery Talent to Will when your spells must resist countermagic.

The GM must determine the maximum level of Sorcery Talent in the campaign. For most games, four levels is a reasonable limit. In a cinematic or over-the-top setting, the GM may wish to raise this to six levels, 10 levels, or no limits at all! See GURPS Powers for much more on power Talents in general."

        desc="Status is a measure of social standing. In most game worlds, Status levels range from -2 (serf or street person) to 8 (powerful emperor or godking), with the average man being Status 0 (freeman or ordinary citizen). If you do not specifically buy Status, you have Status 0. Status costs 5 points per level. For instance, Status 5 costs 25 points, while Status -2 is -10 points. Status also costs money to maintain (see p. 516). Status is not the same as personal popularity (see Reputation, p. 26) or the popularity of your racial or ethnic group (see Social Regard, p. 86, and Social Stigma, p. 155). Status can sometimes influence others’ reactions, but its main effect is to spell out where you stand in the social pecking order. In short, Status represents power. High Status Status greater than 0 means you are a member of the ruling class in your culture. Your family may be hereditary nobles (e.g., Plantagenet, Windsor), successful businessmen or politicians (Rockefeller, Kennedy), or some other type of big shots. You may even have achieved Status by your own efforts. As a result, others in your culture only defer to you, giving you a bonus on all reaction rolls. High Status carries various privileges, different in every game world; your GM will give you this information. Note that any high-Status person is a likely target for kidnappers and social climbers, and that some criminal types hate “the ruling class.” Low Status Status less than 0 means you are a serf or a slave, or simply very poor. This is not the same thing as Social Stigma (p. 155). In medieval Japan, for instance, a woman could have high Status, but still get a -1 on reactions due to the Social Stigma of being female. A modern-day criminal could theoretically have any level of Status in conjunction with the Social Stigma of a criminal record. 

The interaction of Status, Social Stigma, and Reputation can give interesting results. For instance, a person who is obviously from a lower social class, or even a disdained minority group, might earn such a reputation as a hero that others react well to him. 

Status as a Reaction Modifier: When the GM makes a reaction roll (see p. 494), the relative Status of the characters involved can affect the reaction. The GM can roleplay NPCs as he likes, of course, but here are some general guidelines:

Higher Status usually gives a reaction bonus. When dealing with a social inferior, apply the difference between your Status levels as a reaction bonus – except, of course, when dealing with someone who resents Status. For instance, if you have Status 3, those of Status 1 react to you at +2, and those of Status 0 react at +3. 

Lower Status may give a penalty. If you are dealing with a higher-Status NPC who is basically friendly, your Status doesn’t matter (as long as it’s positive). After all, the king has a far higher Status than his knights, but he reacts well to them . . . most of the time. But if the NPC is neutral or already angry, lower Status makes it worse (“How dare you, a mere knight, tell me my battle plan is foolish?”). Again, apply the difference in Status levels as a reaction modifier, but in this case it gives a penalty. 

Negative Status usually gives a penalty. If your Status is so low as to be negative, those of higher Status always react badly to you. Apply the difference between your Status and the NPC’s as a reaction penalty, but no worse than -4. 

Recognizing Status Status only affects reaction rolls if it is obvious to those around you. In some settings, your bearing, dress, and speech communicate your Status. Indeed, if you have very high Status, your face may be easily recognized – or perhaps the gaggle of servants that surrounds you gets the message across. 

In other societies, you will have to produce physical proof (ID cards, signet rings, etc.), pass a test, or submit to ultra-tech or magical scans before you will be recognized. Status costs no fewer points in such societies; you may get fewer reaction bonuses, but you can also live a normal life, and it is far more difficult for someone to impersonate you.."

• A bonus of +1 per level on all reaction rolls made by anyone in a position to notice your Talent, if he would be impressed by your aptitude (GM’s judgment). To receive this bonus, you must demonstrate your Talent – most often by using the affected skills. 

• A reduction in the time required to learn the affected skills in play, regardless of how you learn them. Reduce the time required by 10% per level of Talent; e.g., Animal Friend 2 would let you learn animal-related skills in 80% the usual time. This has no effect on the point cost of your skills. You may never have more than four levels of a particular Talent. However, overlapping Talents can give skill bonuses (only) in excess of +4.

Telecommunication works amid even the loudest noises, although interference and jamming can disrupt your signal. Those with suitable equipment may attempt to locate, intercept, or jam your transmission.

Infrared Communication: Base range is 500 yards in a direct line of sight. 10 points.

FTL: Your signal travels faster than the speed of light, letting you communicate with little or no “light lag.” The GM decides what kinds of Telecommunication can have this modifier and what it represents in each case: a beam of FTL energy for Radio or Gravity-Ripple Comm, a stream of FTL particles for Neutrino Comm, etc. A “hyperspace tunnel” that carries ordinary signals might suit any kind of Telecommunication. Recommended signal speed is 0.1 parsec/day, to a maximum range in parsecs equal to 1/5,000 ordinary range in miles, but the GM can adjust this to suit the setting.

Specify how you do this; possibilities include magnetism, psionic psychokinesis, an ultra-tech “tractor beam,” or a supernatural “poltergeist effect.” 

You can manipulate distant objects just as if you were grasping them in a pair of hands with ST equal to your Telekinesis (TK) level. You can move any object you have strength enough to lift, at a Move equal to your TK level, modified as usual for encumbrance level (see Encumbrance and Move, p. 17). Regardless of level, maximum range is 10 yards. To modify range, take Increased Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range (p. 115). 

Telekinesis requires constant concentration to use. In combat, this means you must take a Concentrate maneuver on your turn. Your TK may then perform one standard maneuver as if were a disembodied pair of hands at some point within your range: a Ready maneuver to pick up an object; a Move maneuver to lift and carry it; an Attack maneuver to throw it, or to grab or strike directly; and so on. 

No rolls are necessary for ordinary lifting and movement. For more complex actions, the GM might require you to make a DX or skill roll. In situations where you would roll against ST, roll against your TK level instead. All of the above assumes that you are using TK to perform a task at a distance. TK can also discreetly assist you with such skills as Gambling (especially to cheat!), Lockpicking, and Surgery. In general, anything that would benefit from High Manual Dexterity (p. 59) gets a +4 bonus if you can successfully make an IQ roll to use your TK properly. On a failure, the GM may assess any penalty he feels is appropriate.

Grappling and Striking: You can use TK to attack a foe directly. Roll against DX or an unarmed combat skill to hit. Your foe defends as if attacked by an invisible opponent (see Visibility, p. 394). If you grapple, your foe cannot grab hold of the TK force, but he can try to break free as usual – and if he also has TK, he can take a Concentrate maneuver and use his TK level instead of his ST. The turn after you grapple a foe using TK, your TK can use a Move maneuver to pick him up off the ground, provided you have enough TK to lift his weight. Someone in this position can’t do anything that relies on ground contact (run, retreat, etc.), but can perform any other action that is possible while grappled. 

Levitation: If you have enough TK to lift your own body weight, you can levitate. Take the Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take Move maneuvers to propel your body. For true psychokinetic flight, take Flight (p. 56) with the Psychokinetic limitation (below). 

Throwing: By applying a TK impulse for a fraction of a second, you can throw objects faster (and farther) than you can move them. Take a Concentrate maneuver and have your TK take an Attack maneuver. This works just as if you were throwing the object with ST equal to your TK level. Roll against Throwing or Thrown Weapon skill to hit, depending on the object being hurled. For 1/2D and Max purposes, measure range from the object (not yourself!) to the target; for the purpose of range penalties, use the sum of the distance from you to the object and from the object to the target. Once you throw something, you have “released” your telekinetic grip – your TK must take a Ready maneuver to pick it up again."
        Sp_lim="Magnetic: Your TK is “super magnetism,” and only affects ferrous metals: iron (including steel), nickel, and cobalt. -50%. 

Psychokinetic: Your ability is part of the Psychokinesis psi power (see p. 256). This makes it mental (2) rather than physical (3). -10%. 

Visible: Your TK is not an invisible force, but a disembodied hand, glowing “tractor beam,” or similar. This makes it much easier for others to defend against your TK attacks (do not use the Visibility rules). -20%.

Animation: Your TK works by enabling inanimate objects to flex. The minimum level required to animate something equals its HP if unliving, half its HP if homogenous (see Object Hit Points Table, p. B558). An animated object can grab, lift, strike, and throw with ST equal to the TK level needed to animate it. It has your DX. It can walk and jump if it isn’t fixed in place; Move equals your TK level minus the level needed to animate it. You can use skills through animated items – but note that objects other than statues and mannequins usually have No Fine Manipulators. Objects return to their rest state once you give up control. Adding Independent (p. 108) lets you animate multiple objects, but you must split your TK level among them. Your TK can’t reach inside things at all. -30% if the object can’t fly; -20% if it can, provided it has wings, rotors, etc. (like a toy dragon or model helicopter). 

Attraction/Repulsion: Your TK can only move things directly toward or away from you. Take a Ready maneuver to move an unresisting object, or an Attack maneuver to affect an active opponent. Your TK can’t strike blows, manipulate objects, or hold an enemy in place or prevent him from attacking. Attraction simply causes objects to move until they’re in contact with you, whereupon they’re held there with your telekinetic ST until you turn off your ability. Repulsion shoves objects away from you until they reach the maximum range of your ability. In either case, objects can only move or be moved in the opposite direction if the mover wins a Quick Contest of his ST or TK level against your TK level. This limitation is incompatible with Animation. -60% for Attraction or Repulsion; -30% for Attraction/Repulsion (it takes a Ready maneuver to switch between the two).

Cannot Punch: Your TK is the ability to move objects, specifically. You cannot punch a foe with an invisible fist; you need to pick something up and hit him with it. -10%."
        Sp_enh="Super-Effort: The GM may allow the Super-Effort enhancement from Lifting ST (p. 58) on TK, too. This affects extra-effort lifts – not speed, damage, skill, or anything else. The only differences from the Lifting ST rules are that TK with Super-Effort works at a range and that its bonus adds to levels of TK that lack this modifier, not to personal ST (e.g., TK 20 gives ST 5,000, or adds 5,000 to unmodified TK, if any).

Animate Life-Forms: Your TK works like Animation (GURPS Powers, p. 83), but you aren’t limited to controlling inanimate objects. You can take control of a person’s or animal’s body. This requires a Quick Contest of your telekinetic ST against the target’s ST. If you win, the target acts with its own ST and with your DX; its Move cannot exceed your margin of victory in the Quick Contest. +100%. 

Animate Life-Forms, Partial: As above, but you can control just one body part of your target. This is easier to do; use the part’s hit location modifier as a bonus to your effective telekinetic ST. See Independent Body Parts (GURPS Powers, p. 52) for the capabilities of separate body parts. +20%. 

Based on (Different Attribute): Telekinesis with this enhancement uses the same attribute for all rolls. For example, a psi with TK (Based on IQ) would roll against IQ to grapple a person, to wield a sword, or to help pick a lock. He could substitute (for example) an IQ-based Broadsword skill roll, if higher, to use the sword. +20%. 

Reduced Time: In a cinematic campaign, the GM may allow Reduced Time solely to shorten the time it takes your TK to pick something up. For example, Reduced Time 1 would allow you to lift objects up to 8xBL in two seconds, up to 2xBL in one second, and up to BL as a free action, allowing you to pick it up and throw it on the same turn.

Super-Damage: Like Super-Effort, but it also affects the damage you inflict by striking or throwing. +900%."

Hindrance: A specific substance (e.g., silver or wood) prevents healing – whether by natural means or Regeneration – for as long as it remains in your body. Once you pass out from your injuries, you stay dormant until this substance is removed. The limitation value depends on the rarity of the substance: -5% if “Rare,” -15% if “Occasional,” or -25% if “Common.”

Players are free to suggest Unusual Backgrounds to the GM, but the GM decides whether a proposed Unusual Background is acceptable, and if so, what its cost and benefits are.

Vibration Sense is not a substitute for vision. You can locate an opponent in the dark, but you cannot detect details (e.g., whether he is armed). In a perfectly still, dark chamber, you would have only a vague notion of the size of the area, but you would be able to sense a barrier before you ran into it, and could find openings by sensing the flow of air or water.

To use Vibration Sense, make a Sense roll. Consult the Size and Speed/Range Table (p. 550) and apply separate bonuses for the target’s size and speed, and a penalty for the range to the target. Wind (in air) or swift currents (in water) will generate “noise” that interferes with your sense. Find the speed of the wind or current on the table and assess the relevant speed penalty. 

A successful roll reveals the rough size, location, speed, and direction of movement of the target. It does not provide any information about the object’s shape, color, etc. Once you have detected something, you may target it with an attack. The modifiers that applied to your Sense roll also apply to your attack roll, but can never give you a bonus to hit.

This works even when you’re in a sealed suit or a vacuum, and isn’t subject to interference by environmental noise. This gives all the benefits of Universal; there’s no need to take both enhancements. +100%. 

Targeting: By taking an Aim maneuver, you can “lock onto” anything you’ve already detected and determine its precise range and speed, exactly as if you had a technological rangefinder. This gives you +3 to hit that target with an aimed ranged attack. +20%."

        desc="You have the ability to teleport, traveling from point to point without moving through the intervening space. To do so, you must be able to see your destination with your own eyes, or view it remotely (via closed-circuit TV, someone else’s eyes using Mind Reading with the Sensory enhancement, etc.), or visualize it clearly (which is only possible if you have visited it previously in person). 

You can carry up to Basic Lift when you travel, plus any Payload (p. 74). To carry more, or to bring along other people, take the Extra Carrying Capacity enhancement (below). 

Make an IQ roll to activate your ability, modified as follows: Distance penalties appear on the table below. 

Preparation Time: The amount of time taken to prepare for the teleport affects the IQ roll. See p.98 

Removal: If you have a “secondhand” view of the destination, you are at -2 per level of removal. There is an additional -2 to teleport to a place you have visited but cannot see. 

Fatigue Points: Apply a bonus of +1 per FP spent. You must declare this before you roll, and you lose the FP whether you succeed or fail. You never have to spend FP, but it is usually a good idea if you must travel far or without much preparation.

On a success, you appear at your target destination. On a failure, you go nowhere and strain your power: you are at -5 to use it again in the next 10 minutes. On a critical failure, you arrive at the wrong destination. It should seriously inconvenience you. In addition, your power temporarily “burns out” and will not function again for 1d hours.

You can use Warp to evade attacks in combat. Once per turn, you may teleport to any location you can see within 10 yards, instantly. This is considered a dodge. Of course, the IQ roll will be at -10 for instant use. so you might want to spend FP to improve your odds!

You can improve this ability with practice, spending points to add enhancements or remove limitations. You cannot take Reduced Fatigue Cost or Reduced Time (p. 108); instead, take Reliable (below) so that you will need less time or fewer FP to teleport reliably."
        Sp_lim="Hyperjump: You physically move through “hyperspace” or “jump space” to journey between destinations. This is not true, instantaneous teleportation; you have an effective speed, which means the trip takes time. On long trips, you will need to address life-support needs! In addition, you cannot activate Hyperjump in atmosphere and you cannot travel distances shorter than one light-second (186,000 miles, -10 to IQ). This effectively limits you to space travel. There is one benefit to Hyperjump: if you possess Navigation (Hyperspace) skill, you may substitute it for IQ. -50% if your effective speed is the speed of light (every 186,000 miles traveled takes one second); -25% if you can travel one light-year (-17 to IQ) per day. 

Naked: You can carry nothing when you teleport! You always arrive naked. -30%. 

Psionic Teleportation: Your ability is part of the Teleportation psi power (see p. 257). -10%. 

Range Limit: You cannot teleport more than a certain distance per hop. Choose a range and find its distance penalty above. The limitation is worth -5% x (10 + penalty); e.g., 10 yards (-0) would be -50%, while 100 miles (-6) would be -20%.

Anchored: You can only teleport to a specific site or item (e.g., a magical beacon). You can’t go anywhere else. This is incompatible with all special modifiers except Extra Carrying Capacity, Naked, No Strain, and Reliable. -50% if you teleport to a single site, but can switch this by physically visiting a new site for a minute; -60% if you teleport to a specific item that you can physically move from location to location, but that enemies could steal or place in danger; -80% for a single, fixed site. 

Blind Only: You must teleport to a set of coordinates exactly as if using the Blind enhancement, even if you can see or visualize your destination. Thus, you’re always at -5, and each +1 costs 2 FP. Blind Only is mutually exclusive with Blind. -50%. 

Drift: You never arrive right on target. You appear at a random location somewhere in a circle with a radius equal to 1% of the distance you teleported (minimum one yard); e.g., if you teleported 10 miles, you’d materialize somewhere in a 0.1-mile circle around your target. The better your IQ roll, the closer you’ll be to your target, but it’s up to the GM exactly where you appear. On a critical failure, you’re likely to appear high in the air or underground. -15%. 

Projection: You teleport your mind as a “ghost” while your body stays behind. See the Projection limitation under Jumper (p. 58) for details. Projection is incompatible with Extra Carrying Capacity, Naked, and Tunnel. 

Special Portal: You need a particular sort of gateway to use your advantage. The value depends on the rarity of the required portal (GM’s decision). “Any reflective surface” is -20%; manmade “stargates” in every important star system are -40%; and a handful of ancient stone circles that only work a few nights of the year are -80%.

Blink Only: You can only use your Warp to avoid incoming attacks by teleporting up to 10 yards in a random direction; roll at full skill to do so. This is incompatible with Blink (GURPS Powers, p. 89), Emergencies Only, and Range Limit (as it subsumes them). -60%. 

Exoteleport: Your carrying capacity is figured purely from your Basic Lift, without including your body weight. Normally this means you can’t go anywhere with Warp! Use this limitation to figure a diminished-cost version of Warp that can be the effect of an Affliction. By itself, this limitation lets you teleport up to your Basic Lift; use Modified Capacity (below) to alter this. If your weight limit is high enough, you can teleport yourself at a -2 penalty. -50%. 

Modified Capacity: This modifier substitutes for both Extra Carrying Capacity and Naked for Warp with the Exoteleport limitation. Your exoteleport capacity is higher or lower than normal. The table below shows the multiple of your Basic Lift and the associated modifier value. At the GM’s option, the “static” column may be used for a setting in which only psionic power, not physical strength, determines how much a psi can ’port; this is assumed for the Exoteleport ability (pp. 69-70). 

Value Lift (BL) Lift (Static) 
-30% BL/20 lbs. 1 lb. 
-25% BL/10 lbs. 2 lbs.
-20% BL/5 lbs. 4 lbs.
-15% BL/3 lbs. 7 lbs.
-10% BL/2 lbs. 10 lbs.
-5% BLx3/4 lbs. 15 lbs.
0% BL lbs. 20 lbs.
+5% BLx1.5 lbs. 30 lbs.
+10% BLx2 lbs. 40 lbs.
+15% BLx2.5 lbs. 50 lbs.
+20% BLx3 lbs. 60 lbs.
+25% BLx4.5 lbs. 90 lbs.
+30% BLx6 lbs. 120 lbs.
+35% BLx7 lbs. 140 lbs.
+40% BLx8 lbs. 160 lbs.
+45% BLx9 lbs. 180 lbs.
+50% BLx10 lbs. 200 lbs.

Every additional +5% adds another BLx2 or 40 lbs."
        Sp_enh="Blind: You can teleport to a specific set of coordinates (distance and direction) without seeing or having visited the destination. This gives you an extra -5 to your IQ roll! You must pay two FP per +1 bonus when using this enhancement. +50%. 

Extra Carrying Capacity: You can carry more than your Basic Lift. If your carrying capacity is high enough, you may transport one person with you. Light encumbrance is +10%; Medium, +20%; Heavy, +30%; ExtraHeavy, +50%. 

Reliable: Your power is stable and predictable. Each level of this enhancement gives +1 to the IQ roll to use this ability, allowing you to teleport with little preparation (e.g., in combat) or over long distances without spending as many FP to improve your odds. +5% per +1, to a maximum of +10. 

Warp Jump: This enhancement is only available if you have the Jumper advantage (p. 64). You must apply it to both Jumper and Warp. When you jump, you can simultaneously use Warp to appear anywhere at your destination. Two die rolls are necessary – one per ability. +10% per linked Jumper advantage.

Blink: Your ability works reflexively in times of stress. Once per turn, you can dodge an attack by making an IQ roll without the -10 for lack of preparation. Roll randomly for direction. You appear in the first safe open space in that direction. If there’s no place like that within 10 yards, you go nowhere and your dodge fails. Blink is triggered by fear and adrenaline; thus, it generally only works in combat, although the GM may let you roll in other dangerous situations. Blink is incompatible with Hyperjump. +25%. 

No Strain: You ability isn’t vulnerable to strain and burnout. You still go nowhere on a failure – and somewhere else on a critical failure – but you can always make an immediate repeated attempt at no extra penalty, and your Warp advantage never “burns out.” +25%. 

Gyroscopic: You do not need to make Body Sense rolls after warping. +10%.

Tracking: You can “follow” another teleporter. Apply all the usual modifiers to your roll, plus -1 per yard of distance between you and his departure point. The time since he teleported also affects your roll. Use the modifiers for preparation time but reverse the sign, giving from +10 if he just left to -10 if he left eight hours ago. Add a further -1 per doubling of time after that. If your quarry departed from the same point more than once, you can only follow his most recent trip. Success means you appear at his arrival point . . . even if he went somewhere bad due to a critical failure or Drift. Failure by 1 means you follow but suffer the effects of Drift. Greater failure works as usual for Warp. +20%. 

Tunnel: Using your ability always creates a portal of about your size, which lingers for 3d seconds. Anyone may step through it. +40% if it forms after you teleport; +100% if it forms beforehand, and you must be free to move to use it but don’t have to go through at all (the GM may allow this version for Jumper and Permeation, too).

Mental Carrying Capacity: Your carrying capacity for teleportation is based on the strength of your psyche, not of your body. Basic Lift is equal to the square of your Will, divided by 5, in pounds; use the table on p. B17, but base it on Will instead of ST. You can buy Extra Carrying Capacity as usual, also based on Will instead of ST. This can let you teleport a load bigger than you can physically lift or carry, as long as you’re touching it. +20%.

Rapid Fire: This enhancement can be applied to Warp to produce a character who teleports two or more times in a single turn with a single Concentrate maneuver. All the destinations and the sequence in which they are reached must be chosen at the outset. The distance modifier is based on the single longest distance between two consecutive points in the sequence. Success means you make your first hop, plus further hops equal to your margin of success. Cost is as on p. B108.

Telekinetic Carrying Capacity: Comparable to Mental Carrying Capacity, but your Basic Lift is determined by your Telekinesis level instead of your ST. Obviously, you have to have Telekinesis (p. B92)! You can teleport any object you have in your telekinetic grasp without physically touching it. If you are touching the object but haven’t telekinetically locked onto it, you can’t teleport it. +20%."

        desc="You do not officially exist. Even the highest authorities in the land know nothing about you. In a fantasy setting, you are a “mysterious wanderer”; magical divination cannot discover conclusive details about your past or true identity. In a high-tech world, you don’t appear in the public records – and if computer databases exist, they contain no evidence of your existence. You must provide a reason for this; e.g., your parents hid you away at birth, you are legally dead, or you somehow managed to destroy all the records (explain how!). 

To maintain this status, you must deal strictly in cash or commodities. Credit and bank accounts must be blind (keyed to pass-code, not a person – the “Swiss bank account”) or set up through a Temporary Identity (see p. 31). 

If the authorities investigate you, they will initially assume that there has been an error. They will become increasingly concerned as no information can be found about your life. Eventually, they will attempt to apprehend you. If they can’t find you, then they’re likely to give up. But if they catch you, you are in for a thorough interrogation, possibly involving torture, mind probes, or worse. After all, a nonperson has no rights . . . and it will be very difficult for your allies to prove that you are being held, as you don’t officially exist!"
